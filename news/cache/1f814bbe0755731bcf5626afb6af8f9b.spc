(UKIP) looks set for a night of celebration, with <a href="http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/10/nigel-farages-krakatoa-day-arrives/">
the likely victory of Douglas Carswell</a> in the Clacton
by-election. Carswell will be the first elected UKIP member of the
House of Commons, an event UKIP leader Nigel Farage has claimed
will <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11149953/Ukip-breakthrough-in-Clacton-by-election-would-be-a-Kratatoa-moment-says-Nigel-Farage.html">
"shift the tectonic plates"</a> of British politics.</p>
<p>Carswell’s election comes at a pivotal time for UKIP, with the
party’s evolving ideological identity drawing increasing attention
from commentators and supporters alike. Their changing identity has
involved a slow abandonment of libertarian principles in favor of a
strongly anti-immigrant form of populist nationalism.</p>
<p>This slow drift toward statism has previously been covered by
<em><a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/05/21/how-libertarian-is-the-uk-independence-p">
Reason’s Tom Clougherty</a></em>, but recent reports from
<em>Brietbart London</em> suggest that <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/10/07/When-did-UKIP-become-an-enemy-of-the-Right">
UKIP has now abandoned libertarianism</a> altogether. Alex Wickham
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few months ago, UKIP’s website offered a one line description
of itself as “a libertarian, non-racist party seeking withdrawal
from the European Union”. At some point between then and now, that
description changed. It now reads: “UKIP is a patriotic party that
promotes independence: from the EU, and from government
interference”. A subtle difference, but a notable one. <strong>UKIP
has abandoned its claim to represent a ‘libertarian’ political
ideology</strong>. [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wickham goes on to discuss how the party has reversed its
opposition to Britain’s National Healthcare System (NHS) and has
even begun attacking libertarianism by name.</p>
<p>The article provoked a quick <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/10/08/UKIP-Has-Not-Moved-To-The-Left-Or-Dropped-Libertarianism">response
from Tom Bursnall</a>, a UKIP member of the Windsor and
Maidenhead Council and of UKIP’s National Executive Committee.
Bursnall claimed that UKIP remained a “libertarian party” but that
the change in branding was necessary for the party to appeal to a
broader section of the electorate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the average chap on the streets of Basingstoke or Bromley
know the philosophical attractions of Neo Classical Liberalism?
Probably not – so, best to communicate on a level we all
understand…In short we are appealing to a broader spectrum of
voters than both the Tories and Labour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting aside his reference to “Neo Classical Liberalism,” a
pejorative term generally used by progressives to create an
artificial division between enlightenment-era (classical)
liberalism and modern libertarianism, Burnsnall still fails to take
into account the effect UKIP’s change of strategy has had on the
party’s makeup.</p>
<p>As Wickham notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The party has lost a considerable amount of support from
libertarian-leaning people in the last two years, people who made
up an important core only a couple of years ago, who have now left
the party in disgust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shouldn't come as a surprise. There has long been tension
within UKIP between its embrace of libertarianism and its embrace
of British nationalism. These two conflicting ideological
viewpoints were mostly able to coexist while UKIP remained a
predominantly EU-focused party. However, the pursuit of domestic
electoral success has placed this coexistence under increasing
strain.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the libertarianism that existed within UKIP was
doomed the moment its leadership decided to base its electoral
strategy on an anti-immigrant fearmongering campaign. Bringing new
voters and members into the fold had a significant influence on the
makeup of the party. From there, it was only a matter of time
before the libertarian label, and certain libertarian polices,
would start to be seen as electoral liabilities.</p>
<p>If their current approach continues, even UKIP’s <em>raison
d'etre</em> may be put at risk. The success of efforts to exit the
EU will depend on garnering support from across the political
spectrum—support that will be far harder to attract if opponents
are able to tie an EU exit to UKIP’s anti-immigrant populism.</p>		</div>

<p>To hear many people tell it these days, the most pressing
concern when it comes to sexual assault is making non-enthusiastic
consent a crime. Yet there are much bigger barriers to emboldening
victims than an insufficiently robust consent statute, Elizabeth
Nolan Brown writes. In many states, victims of sexual assault are
being forced to shoulder some or all of the cost of testing their
bodies for forensic evidence. We don't ask home-invasion victims to
cover the cost of dusting for fingerprints or the families of
homicide victims to subsidize blood spatter analysis. So why should
rape victims have to pay the state to investigate?</p>			<p><a href="http://reason.com/archives/2014/10/09/rape-victims-charged-for-forensic-tests">View this article.</a></p>

hear many people tell it these days, the most pressing concern when
it comes to sexual assault is making non-enthusiastic consent a
crime. Rape is underreported, they say, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/videos/31109?in=04:29&amp;out=12:09">and
therefore we must encourage more victims</a> to come forward by
making it clear the state thinks <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/10/oh-yes-means-yes-the-joy-of-affirmative-consent.html">
only yes means yes</a>. Rape <em><a href="http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/rape-sexual-violence/Pages/rape-notification.aspx">
is</a></em> <a href="http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/rape-sexual-violence/Pages/rape-notification.aspx">
underreported</a>, yet there are much bigger barriers to
emboldening victims than insufficiently robust consent statutes.
One that receives proportionately less attention: In states across
the U.S., rape victims are forced to shoulder the cost of their own
forensic exams. </p>
<p>It sounds almost too unbelievable to be true, doesn't it? We
don't ask home-invasion victims to cover the cost of dusting for
fingerprints or the families of homicide victims to subsidize blood
spatter analysis. But rape victims are being billed for the cost of
collecting forensic evidence in the crimes against them. </p>
<p>This runs contrary to federal law, which says states or
municipalities must fund investigating rape allegations as they
would any other crime. When the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)
was reauthorized in 2005, it stipulated that all states must either
provide a free forensic medical exam directly or provide
reimbursement for such an exam, regardless of whether a victim
ultimately decides to press charges or cooperate with law
enforcement. The 2013 reauthorization (which takes effect in 2015)
specifies that victims can't be charged up front for the exam (also
<a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2010/04/07/whats-in-a-rape-kit/">
known as a "rape kit"</a>) and asked to seek reimbursement from
insurance later.</p>
<p>But they say the devil is in the details, and the VAWA doesn't
provide many, leaving it up to states and municipalities to work
out who covers what. Thirty-four states pay for forensic exams
using money from their general victim compensation funds, according
to a May <a href="http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/413122-Who-Pays-for-Sexual-Assault-Medical-Forensic-Exams.pdf">report</a>
from Urban Institute. (These funds are generally built from fines
and penalties <a href="http://www.ovc.gov/about/victimsfund.html">paid by convicted
offenders</a>, not tax dollars.) Eleven states leave it to local
law enforcement or prosecution funds; some use a combination of
special funds and money from state public safety or health and
human services departments; and three, including Louisiana, leave
it to the county or parish to cover the cost. </p>
<p>In Louisiana, local coroners are supposed to provide the free
forensic exams. "But in many cases, such as in New Orleans,
cash-strapped coroners outsource that responsibility to another
entity" such as local hospitals, <em><a href="http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2014/09/louisiana_rape_victims_often_b.html">
The Times-Picayune</a></em><a href="http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2014/09/louisiana_rape_victims_often_b.html"> reported
in September</a>. And these hospitals vary greatly in how and whom
they bill. Some eat the whole cost themselves, or did until
recently. Some cover testing for forensic evidence but bill
victims for things like pregnancy and HIV tests. Some send patients
the full tab, some bill insurance companies, and some bill the
state. Some require anyone seeing a Sexual Assault Nurse
Examiner—the only hospital staff qualified to collect forensic
evidence from rape victims—to be admitted through the emergency
room, which adds hundreds of dollars to the total tab.</p>
<p>"Whether a patient gets charged-and how much-varies according to
what hospital they go to, who the admitting staff on duty are, and
whether the billing employees know the processes for charging rape
victims," <em>Times-Picayune</em> reporter Rebecca Catalenello
found in talking to both rape victims and hospital staff. </p>
<p>The cost of collecting forensic evidence can vary, but it tends
to run upwards of $1,000, so this isn't some minor expense we're
talking about. Victims who are mistakenly billed by hospitals
for rape kits can apply for reimbursement from the Louisiana Crime
Victims Reparations Board—<a href="http://www.lcle.state.la.us/programs/cvr.asp#basicqual">but not
if</a> they have any felony convictions in the past five
years, have been on parole recently, were doing anything illegal
(like using drugs) at the time of the assault, were assaulted while
incarcerated, or have acted in any way that the board determines
"contributed to the crime."</p>
<p>When I first read about this astonishing situation in Louisiana,
I thought perhaps it was some sort of state anomaly. My colleague
Lauren Galik, the Reason Foundation's director of criminal justice
reform, tells me that Louisiana is aces at infuriatingly
unjust criminal justice policy. Surely other states have more
reasonable mechanisms for funding forensic tests? </p>
<p>Some do. Too many don't. In places where crime-victim funds are
used to pay for rape kits, many continue to impose conditions on
victims, at least according to their websites. Maine's crime-victim
reparation site says a victim must come forward within five days to
be eligible for funds, "unless there is a good cause for delay." In
Arkansas, Montana, and North Dakota, it's 72 hours. The majority of
sites I looked at said crime victims must cooperate with law
enforcement in order to be eligible, despite the VAWA directly
forbidding this.</p>
<p>Some states <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/05/13/making-rape-victims-pay">cap
compensation for the testing</a> at a few hundred dollars. And in a
lot of states, the victims fund websites specifically note that
they are a "payer of last resort", and attempts must first be made
to recoup costs from a victim's insurance company. The Louisiana
Crime Victims Reparations Fund, for instance, states that it is "a
secondary source that pays for certain out-of-pocket expenses
related to the crime" and attempts will first be made to collect
the money from a victim's health insurance, disability insurance,
Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. </p>
<p>That's the practice for all crime victims, mind you—someone who
is severely beat up in the course of a robbery would be asked to
seek insurance coverage for their hospital bills. Yet the
collection of crime-scene evidence on law enforcement's dime is a
given still. The crime victim's fund may or may not cover medical
care, but there's no question that the police department will pay
for the gathering and testing of things like fingerprints and
potential DNA evidence.</p>
<p>With rape, the victim's body may be the only crime scene, and
collecting forensic evidence &amp; receiving medical care are part
of the same process. It's not that states have some totally
nefarious or mysogynistic plot to treat rape differently than other
crimes; but it does show that we still don't know how to treat rape
in the criminal justice system and there's a lot of room for
discussion and reform. </p>		</div>

he got a phone call from his wife that a neighbor told her a German
shepherd killed the Flynn family cat, and went out looking for the
dog. He says he didn't feel safe when he came upon the dog and
another identified as a pit bull he says were "eyeing him" but
followed the German shepherd anyway, eventually catching up to it
behind a barn and shooting it from his SUV.</p>
<p>The Texas health and safety code permits the killing of dogs
seen involved in a recent attack by witnesses or the pets' owners
but Flynn lied to police officers when they asked him about his
involvement. He's now charged with animal cruelty and stripped of
his gun and badge but not yet his job. Flynn's lawyers insist his
actions were legal. The <em>Fort Worth Star Telegram</em> <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20141009-affidavit-fort-worth-deputy-police-chief-at-first-denied-shooting-at-dog.ece">
reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the affidavit, it was Flynn's neighbor, Doug
Goodlett, who had called 911 regarding a dog killing a cat.</p>
<p>But when interviewed by Carmichael at the scene, Goodlett
refused to tell the deputy who was out shooting at dogs.</p>
<p>"I have to live here; I'm not saying anything," Goodlett
responded, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>When the deputy asked Flynn if he had been out chasing the dogs,
"Flynn replied that he had just gotten home."</p>
<p>When later contacted by special investigation Detective S.J.
Waters, Goodlett at first refused to answer her questions, stating
repeatedly, "I don't know nothing about nothing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the criminal charge, Flynn is being investigated
by internal affairs.</p>		</div>

<p>The <a href=
"http://reason.com/poll/2014/10/09/october-2014-reason-rupe-poll">latest
Reason-Rupe poll</a> finds nearly eight out of 10 Americans—77
percent—favor eliminating mandatory minimum prison sentences for
nonviolent offenders so that judges instead have the ability to
make sentencing decisions on a case-by-case basis. Only 17 percent
of Americans oppose the idea. Support for eliminating mandatory
minimum sentences has increased by 6 percentage points since
Reason-Rupe asked this question in <a href=
"http://reason.com/poll/2013/12/13/poll-71-percent-of-americans-want-to-el2">
December 2013</a>.</p>
<p>The federal government and a number of states have enacted
mandatory minimum sentencing laws over the past few decades, most
of which were applied to drug offenses. These laws require judges
to sentence offenders convicted of certain crimes to a minimum term
of imprisonment, regardless of whether or not the judge agrees the
sentence is in the best interest of justice. These types of
sentencing laws prohibit judges from evaluating the circumstances
of individual cases and assigning the punishment they find most
appropriate.</p>
<p>Instead, mandatory minimums transfer sentencing authority from
judges to prosecutors, who pressure defendants to plead guilty in
exchange for a shorter sentence, rather than go to trial and risk
receiving a much longer mandatory minimum sentence if convicted.
According to <a href=
"http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/annual-reports-and-sourcebooks/2013/Table11.pdf">
a report</a> by the United States Sentencing Commission, an average
of 98.7 percent of offenders who were convicted of a federal drug
offense pleaded guilty in FY 2013 to avoid going to trial.</p>
<p>The poll found that Americans of all races and political parties
favor eliminating mandatory minimum sentences, and that support
among all groups has grown since the end of last year.</p>
<p>When Reason-Rupe asked this question in December 2013, 74
percent of Democrats favored eliminating mandatory minimums, while
72 percent of Independents and 68 percent of Republicans agreed.
This time around, 81 percent of Democrats, 75 percent of
Independents, and 73 percent of Republicans supported eliminating
mandatory minimums in favor of judicial discretion.</p>
<p>The results for this question were similar among Americans of
different races/ethnicities as well. Seventy-seven percent of
whites, 80 percent of African Americans, and 73 percent of
Hispanics favored eliminating mandatory minimums. When this
question was asked in 2013, 71 percent of whites, 69 percent of
African-Americans, and 75 percent of Hispanics were in
favor.&#160;</p>
<p>These results only demonstrate that Americans are overwhelmingly
in favor of returning sentencing discretion to judges and do not
indicate whether or not Americans support the type of lengthy
prison terms mandatory minimum sentencing laws require for
nonviolent offenders. But they at least make clear that public
opinion no longer favors the status quo. Simply put, mandatory
minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders are becoming
increasingly unpopular and harder to defend.</p>		</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Chidi spoke with Owens' former fiancée, who claimed that he had
financially abandoned her and their child. The story also described
an instance in which the head of a Christian charity filed a police
report against Owens for allegedly coming to her thrift shop,
spitting on her door and saying that she had “insufficient hate”
toward African Muslims.</p>
<p>The article was posted at 9 a.m. on Monday, and that afternoon
Chidi wrote that he was served with the <a href="http://www.peachpundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Owens-TPO.pdf">temporary
protective order</a>, which prohibits him from "stalking, harassing
and/or intimidating" Owens, having any contact with Owens or coming
within 100 yards of him. The order was signed by DeKalb County
Superior Court Judge Nora Polk. A hearing on the order was
scheduled for Oct. 22, just two weeks before the election.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't seem like Chidi was actually harassing Owens. Video
footage of an encounter between the two—when Chidi last tried to
get on-the-record comments from Owens—merely shows an eager
journalist seeking answers from a conflict-averse candidate.</p>
<p>The restraining order applies to both actual and virtual
contact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday, Chidi told HuffPost that he had also been served
with a notice that he had violated the order by "contacting third
parties via social media."</p>
<p>Chidi said that he's worried his case could set a dangerous
precedent for journalists who write unfavorably about
politicians.</p>
<p>“Imagine a politician who can shut off a journalist covering him
in the month before an election when everybody is paying attention
to politics,” he told HuffPost. “It is chilling. It makes it much
more fraught to report on issues of public importance, particularly
around politics.”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous to the public to have a court tell a journalist
to stay away from public figures and political candidates," Chidi
added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dangerous, indeed.</p>
<p>Owens has charged that Chidi is a Democratic activist and
blogger, rather than a journalist. But that shouldn't make any
difference—First Amendment press freedoms apply to everyone, not
just traditional news reporters.</p>		</div>

<p>If children are not vaccinated, then a majority—52 percent—of

<p>"If we one day develop machines with general intelligence that
surpasses ours, they would be in a <em>very</em> powerful
position," says <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/">Nick
Bostrom</a>,&#160;Oxford professor and founding director of the
<a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity
Institute</a>.</p>
<p>Bostrom sat down with <em>Reason</em> science correspondent
<a href=
"http://reason.com/archives/2014/09/12/will-superintelligent-machines-destroy-h">
Ron Bailey</a> to discuss his latest book, <a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199678111/reasonmagazineA/"><em>Superintelligence:
Paths, Dangers, Strategies</em></a>, in which he discusses the
risks humanity will face when artificial intelligence (AI) is
created. Bostorm worries that, once computer intelligence exceeds
our own, machines will be beyond of our control and will seek to
shape the future according to their own plan. If the AI's goals
aren't properly set by designers, a superintelligent machine will
see humans as a liability to completing its goals–leading to our
annihilation.</p>

Dear Leader Kim Jong-un has been out of the public eye. Tomorrow
marks the 69th anniversary of the founding of the nation's
ruling party, and rumors are swirling about Kim's health and North
Korea's political future.</p>
<p>Aptly nicknamed "The Hermit Kingdom," not a lot of information
comes out of North Korea, and what does must be taken with a grain
of salt. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_in_reporting_on_North_Korea">Plenty</a>
of bogus stories, like the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/01/03/no-kim-jong-un-probably-didnt-feed-his-uncle-to-120-hungry-dogs/">
execution-by-120-dogs</a> one earlier this year, make the
rounds in Western media.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, here's what people are saying.</p>
<p>"The betting is that the increasingly obese Kim is merely
suffering from a physical ailment, most likely gout," <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-08/kim-jong-un-s-absence-fuels-rumors-over-his-hold-on-power.html">
according</a> to <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>. In the
31-year-old's last appearance he was limping. This fanned rumors
that Kim fractured an ankle from <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/11131885/Kim-Jong-un-so-fat-he-has-fractured-his-ankles.html">
weigh gain</a> and wearing high-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>He missed a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/09/25/kim-jong-un-hasnt-seen-for-weeks-and-no-one-is-quite-sure-why/">
significant parliament meeting</a> late last month, which began
raising eyebrows.</p>
<p>Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University
in the Netherlands, <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/25215727/kim-jong-un-may-be-under-house-arrest-north-korean-dictators-absence-from-public-eye-seen-as-sign-of-possible-power-shift-in-pyongyang-elite/">
tells </a>Australia's ABC today that "we're not sure where he
is or what's happening," but one possibility is that "he's been put
under house arrest."</p>
<p><em>Vice</em>, which previously documented Dennis Rodman's
journey to North Korea, <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/former-top-official-says-kim-jong-un-is-no-longer-in-control-of-north-korea">
reported</a> one week ago that Jang Jin-sung, "formerly a key
member of Kim Jong-il's propaganda machine" who was at a conference
of exiled elites, said that Kim is no longer in control, and the
powerful Organization and Guidance Department has essentially taken
power. "On one hand, it's people who want to maintain a regime
monopoly. On the other hand, it's not like people are fighting
against the regime, but in a policy sense they want to take
advantage to get influence. It's not actually consciously civil
war, but there are these two incompatible forces at play."</p>
<p>The notion that Kim isn't at the wheel anymore was bolstered
this past weekend when two of the nation's most senior officials
made an <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/top-north-korean-officials-make-surprise-visit-to-south-korea">
abrupt and surprisingly friendly</a> visit to South Korea.</p>
<p>Another rumor this week is that Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, may
be in temporarily in control.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/08/world/kim-jong-un-sister/index.html">
CNN</a> today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies who previously handled the North Korea
account with the National Security Council, says Kim Yo Jong began
surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions.</p>
<p>"Clearly it's an effort to slow-track her into becoming somebody
who is important within the system," Cha says. "I can see how it's
possible that she's in some sort of temporary position. It's very
difficult for the North Korean system to run without one of the Kim
family at least titularly in charge. So, if Kim Jong-un is
indisposed, she's really the only available body that's left, in
terms of a direct Kim family line."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, "a source with access to the secretive
North's leadership" apparently <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/09/us-northkorea-kim-idUSKCN0HY09T20141009">
told</a> Reuters today that "Kim Jong-un is in total control" and
that he simply pulled a tendon while conducting military
exercises.</p>
<p>Likewise, <em>The Washington Times</em> quote a U.S.
intelligence official who <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/8/us-intel-kim-jong-un-still-in-charge-in-north-kore/">
says</a>, "The fact that <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kim-jong-un/">Kim
Jong-un</a> is out of sight is not necessarily an indication
that he's not in control of the country. Despite the rumors, there
are many indications that the country is functioning as it normally
does."</p>		</div>

<p>"If we one day develop machines with general intelligence that
surpasses ours, they would be in a <em>very</em> powerful
position," says <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/">Nick
Bostrom</a>,&#160;Oxford professor and founding director of the
<a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity
Institute</a>.</p>
<p>Bostrom sat down with <em>Reason</em> science correspondent
<a href=
"http://reason.com/archives/2014/09/12/will-superintelligent-machines-destroy-h">
Ron Bailey</a> to discuss his latest book, <a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199678111/reasonmagazineA/"><em>Superintelligence:
Paths, Dangers, Strategies</em></a>, in which he discusses the
risks humanity will face when artificial intelligence (AI) is
created. Bostorm worries that, once computer intelligence exceeds
our own, machines will be beyond of our control and will seek to
shape the future according to their own plan. If the AI's goals
aren't properly set by designers, a superintelligent machine will
see humans as a liability to completing its goals–leading to our
annihilation.&#160;</p>
<p>How do we avoid a robot apocalypse? Bostrom proposes two
solutions: either limit the AI to only answering questions in a
preset boundary or engineer the AI to include human preservation.
"We have got to solve the control problem before we solve the AI
problem," Bostrom explains.&#160;"The big challenge then is to
reach into this huge space of possible mind decisions, motivation
system designs, and try to pick out one of the very special ones
that would be consistent with human survival and flourishing."</p>
<p>Until such time, Bostrom believes research into AI should be
dramatically slowed, allowing humanity ample time to understand its
own objectives.&#160;</p>

<p>Except for a few busybodies <a href="http://www.prohibitionparty.org/2012platform.html">yearning</a>
for the halcyon days of the Volstead Act, even otherwise delusional
drug warriors concede that legal alcohol isn't a terrible idea
(<a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/21/because-bob-tyrrell-prefers-scotch-marij">if
for the wrong reasons</a>). But for our <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/opinion/about-those-black-sites.html">
allies</a> in Pakistan, it's a different story. Alcohol is illegal
for Muslims in the deeply religious country, leading to the
predictable congeries of negative consequences—such as death from
the Pakistani equivalent of bathtub gin. <em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-dry-pakistan-deaths-from-toxic-liquor-continue/2014/10/08/bf149e5c-4f1a-11e4-babe-e91da079cb8a_story.html">
The Washington Post reports</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a span of 24 hours this week, at least 21 people died in
Karachi from drinking toxic liquor, health officials said
Wednesday. The victims represented a cross section of residents in
Pakistan's largest city, and officials are worried that the death
toll will mount.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Officials are hopeful they will catch the culprits who distilled
the toxic spirits. But just as capturing drug kingpins <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/178737/what-happens-when-mexicos-drug-kingpin-falls">
doesn't do much</a> to stem the flow of narcotics, it's unlikely
that a government crackdown will have any effect on the burgeoning
industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Officials say bootlegging has become a multimillion-dollar
industry in Pakistan since alcohol consumption was banned in 1977
under then-Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pakistan used to have fairly liberal alcohol laws, until a
growing religious conservatism took root in the '60s and '70s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, in the ensuing decades, underground establishments sold
beer and wine in cities such as Islamabad. But many of them closed
after thousands of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/22/AR2007052201513.html" title="www.washingtonpost.com">students with links to conservative
preachers</a> launched a wave of terror against "un-Islamic"
activities in the capital in 2007.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Righteous teetotalling crusades against tipplers <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-24044337">haven't decreased</a>
alcohol consumption—they've just forced it underground, making
drinking more dangerous. Not even the prospect of 80 lashes can
deter the thirsty.</p>
<p>Other Muslim countries such as <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21579061-its-enough-drive-you-cheaper-forms-drink-wet-and-dry">
Iran</a> have similar alcohol policies—and <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/16/iran-s-drinking-problem.html">
similar problems</a>. There, the high price of smuggled liquor has
driven many to buy homemade booze. Last year, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/world/middleeast/seven-die-in-iran-after-drinking-homemade-alcohol.html">
a bad batch</a> killed seven and hospitalized dozens.</p>
<p>This should come as no surprise, given the <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-157.html">abundant</a> evidence
from America's own ignoble experiment in alcohol prohibition. In
countries with legal alcohol, no one needs to worry about their
Skol vodka being any more toxic than it's supposed to be—as long as
<a href="http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/07/17/russias-vodka-tax-backfiring/">
prohibitive taxes</a> don't drive the market into the shadows, that
is.</p>
<p>The benefits of legalization extend to other drugs. In Colorado,
marijuana stores now offer <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_RETHINKING_POT_MARIJUANA_LITE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-10-09-04-01-52">
a wide range of potency</a> in their products to entice customers.
They are bowing to consumer kings with lower tolerances who don't
want to fall into a zonked-out paranoia a la <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/06/04/maureen-dowd-pot-brownie-twitter/9949991/">
Maureen Dowd</a>. Gone are the days buying schwag from a guy in the
alleyway who doesn't know a sativa from salvia.</p>
<p><span>If puritanical prohibitionists in Muslim countries refuse
to learn the right lessons from alcohol and marijuana prohibition,
they can look forward to more disasters like those in
Karachi.</span></p>		</div>

Only 15 percent of Americans think Congress hasn’t voted because it
believes President Obama does not need their authorization for
military action, and 8 percent felt Congress simply hasn’t had
enough time yet to hold the vote.</p>
<p>This is a rare non-partisan issue in which overwhelming

<p>"When I took office," President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/02/remarks-president-economy-northwestern-university">
bragged</a> last week, "the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our
economy. Today, it’s approaching 3 percent."</p>
<p>All true. And yet it’s worth putting the declining deficit in
context, and remembering that, as a Senator, Obama probably would
have been appalled by his current deficits.</p>
<p>The year’s deficit total, just shy of half a trillion dollars,
represents a big drop from the $1.4 trillion peak it hit in Obama’s
first term. (More than 40 percent of that reduction came as a
<a href="http://crfb.org/document/report-deficit-falls-486-billion-debt-continues-rise">
result</a> of tax hikes.) But the reduction only came following a
massive 800 percent increase in annual deficits.</p>
<p>Notably, it’s still much higher than the typical deficits during
the Bush years, which, you may recall, were worrisomely
large—indeed, they were large enough that Obama, as a Senator in
2005, <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-once-a-critic-of-deficits-obama-now-goes-for-broke/article/2518561">
declared</a> that "you don’t have to be a deficit hawk to be
disturbed by the growing gap between revenues and expenses."
Between the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years, the deficit <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-once-a-critic-of-deficits-obama-now-goes-for-broke/article/2518561">
dropped</a> from $248 billion to $160 billion.</p>
<p>The Bush-era deficit totals, far lower than his own second-term
deficits, were "a sign that the U.S. government can't pay its own
bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial
assistance from foreign countries to finance our government's
reckless fiscal policies." Obama even opposed an increase in the
nation’s debt limit.</p>
<p>But look where we are now: Not only are this year’s lowered
deficits still much higher than the deficits he was worried about
during his predecessor’s presidency, they are on track to skyrocket
again, as this graph <a href="http://crfb.org/document/report-deficit-falls-486-billion-debt-continues-rise">
from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget</a> shows:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="309" src="http://cloudfront-media.reason.com/mc/psuderman/2014_10/CRFB-deficits-Oct-2014.png?h=309&amp;w=500" title="Deficit damage ||| Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget " width="500" /></p>
<p>As the CRFB dryly notes, "Unfortunately, the recent fall in
deficits is not a sign of fiscal sustainability." </p>
<p>And, of course, a temporarily reduced deficit—which measures the
yearly gap between spending and revenues—doesn’t mean a reduction
in total debt. That’s set to rise too. As the Congressional Budget
Office <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/27/cbo-deficit-is-down-but-debt-remains-hig">
noted</a> in August, "The persistent and growing deficits that CBO
projects would result in increasing amounts of federal debt held by
the public." The fiscal situation is not as obviously and
immediately terrible as it was during Obama’s first term, but it’s
hardly anything to brag about.  </p>		</div>

<p>Nearly four out of five Americans, 78 percent, say Congress
should return to Capitol Hill before the November elections to hold
a vote on the authorization for use of military force against
Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq, the <a href=
"http://reason.com/poll/2014/10/09/october-2014-reason-rupe-poll">latest
Reason-Rupe national telephone poll finds.</a>&#160; Just 16
percent of Americans say Congress should not return to Washington
before November to hold a vote on military action in Syria and
Iraq.</p>
<p><a href=
"http://reason.com/poll/2014/10/09/october-2014-reason-rupe-poll">COMPLETE
POLL RESULTS</a></p>
<p>When asked why Congress didn’t vote on the authorization of
military force before leaving for recess, 63 percent of Americans
say members of Congress don’t want to put their vote on the
official record, 15 percent say Congress doesn’t believe President
Obama needs its authorization for military action, and 8 percent
feel Congress simply didn’t have enough time to hold the vote.</p>
<p>Two-thirds, 66 percent, of Americans tell Reason-Rupe they
support the US airstrikes against Islamic State (ISIS) fighters in
Syria and Iraq.&#160; Fifty-eight percent of Americans believe US
ground troops would be necessary to defeat ISIS but only 43 percent
currently support sending US ground troops to fight in Syria and
Iraq, while 52 percent oppose.</p>
<p>There is even less support for arming Syrian rebels — 35 percent
of Americans favor, and 55 percent oppose supplying Syrian rebels
with US weapons to fight ISIS.&#160; That opposition could stem
from the fear that those weapons will eventually be used against
Americans. The public estimates there is a 78 percent chance that
weapons provided to Syrian rebels will ultimately be used against
America or its allies.</p>
<p><strong>Paying for the War Against ISIS</strong></p>
<p>When asked, open-ended, how long they expect the current
military action against ISIS to last, the median answer was two
years.</p>
<p>When it comes to paying for the war against ISIS, the public is
split between raising taxes and cutting spending. To fund the
military action, 42 percent of Americans say they’d raise taxes —
34 percent would increase taxes only on the wealthy and another 8
percent would raise taxes on everyone.&#160; Nearly the same
amount, 39 percent, favor cutting spending — 35 percent want to cut
general federal spending and an additional 4 percent want to cut
entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Six percent
of Americans prefer borrowing money to pay for the war.&#160;</p>
<p>Reason-Rupe asked Americans what federal spending they’d cut
first to pay for the war against ISIS — 19 percent would start with
cuts to social safety net programs like food stamps and
unemployment insurance; 17 percent would reduce infrastructure and
transportation spending; 9 percent would cut science and medical
research; 7 percent would cut Social Security or Medicare; 3
percent would decrease education spending; and 2 percent would cut
veterans programs. Twenty-three percent selected a variety of minor
programs not presented as options and 16 percent said they didn’t
know which program they’d cut.</p>
<p><strong>Comparing Bush and Obama and Revisionist History on the
Iraq War</strong></p>
<p>While the Iraq war was very popular when it was launched, a
majority of Americans, 51 percent, now say they recall being
opposed to the war in 2003. Just 39 percent say they supported the
war in Iraq when it started in 2003. By comparison, a March 2003
national Pew survey found that 72 percent supported the US war in
Iraq.</p>
<p>Eighty-three percent of Americans think the war in Iraq has
either increased the threat of terrorism (38 percent) or didn’t
make a difference (45 percent) on the amount of terrorism, while 14
percent believe the war in Iraq reduced the threat of
terrorism.</p>
<p>Reason-Rupe finds the number of Americans who say President
Obama is doing a better job than President George W. Bush on
foreign policy increased slightly from 32 percent in September 2013
to 35 percent in October 2014. One-third of Americans say Obama is
doing a worse job than his predecessor and 28 percent say he is
doing no better or worse.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Approval Ratings for President Obama,
Congress</strong></p>
<p>Thirty-eight percent of Americans approve of the way President
Obama is handling foreign policy, 51 percent disapprove.</p>
<p>Overall, 43 percent of Americans approve of the job President
Obama is doing, while 50 percent disapprove.</p>
<p>Congress’ approval rating is 19 percent, with 73 percent
disapproving.</p>
<p><strong>Midterm Elections</strong></p>
<p>Forty-two percent of registered voters say they’ll vote for the
Democratic congressional candidate in their district, while 33
percent say they’ll vote for the Republican candidate and 13
percent suggest they’ll vote for a third party or independent
candidate.</p>
<p>About half of voters, 53 percent, are satisfied with the US
House and US Senate candidates they have to choose from. That
satisfaction grows to 57 percent for state-level candidates and 63
percent for candidates running for local offices. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Ebola and Vaccinations</strong></p>
<p>Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the
United States, died on Wednesday.&#160; In August 2014, 40 percent
of Americans thought an Ebola outbreak in the United States was
likely. Now, 62 percent of Americans tell Reason-Rupe an Ebola
outbreak in a US city is likely, while 36 percent say an outbreak
in the US is not likely. Twenty-three percent of the public
believes an Ebola outbreak in a US city is “very likely” and 39
percent say it is “somewhat likely.”&#160;</p>
<p>Six in 10 Americans believe all children should be required to
receive vaccinations for diseases like mumps and measles, while 37
percent feel parents should be able to refuse vaccinations.
&#160;Just over half, 52 percent, of Americans, say unvaccinated
children should not be allowed to attend public schools, 44 percent
think children who haven’t been vaccinated should be allowed in
schools.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory Minimums and Voting Rights for Drug
Offenders</strong></p>
<p>Nearly eight in 10 Americans, 77 percent, favor eliminating
mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. And 73
percent favor restoring voting rights for nonviolent drug offenders
who have served their sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Police Favorability, Misconduct</strong></p>
<p>Seventy-two percent of Americans have a favorable view of the
police, down from 78 percent in April 2014.&#160; With several
police incidents in the news recently, 47 percent of Americans say
police officers are using excessive force more than they have in
the past, while 43 percent say the number of excessive force cases
aren’t going up or down.</p>
<p>When officers are guilty of misconduct, 50 percent of Americans
believe they are held accountable, while 45 percent do not believe
police officers are held accountable for their
misconduct.&#160;</p>
<p>Seven in 10 Americans oppose the use of racial profiling by
police officers. Forty-five percent of Americans believe the
criminal justice system treats whites, African-Americans and
Hispanics equally, while 44 percent think the criminal system
treats whites more fairly than it treats blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p><strong>About the Reason-Rupe Poll</strong></p>
<p>The Reason-Rupe poll interviewed 1,004 adults on mobile (503)
and landline (501) phones from October 1-6, 2014. The poll’s margin
of error is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. Princeton Survey
Research Associates International executed the nationwide
survey.</p>		</div>

got a new piece up <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/269332/hey-liberals-criminalizing-hate-speech-will-inevitably-backfire">
at <em>The Week</em> imploring progressives</a> to think about what
they're really risking when they rush to criminalize free
expression. Some of the social justice left seem to believe that
people "hide behind the First Amendment" because they love gay
slurs and upskirt photos. Even more astonishingly, they think that
broad laws criminalizing speech and expression could never be used
in ways they don't intend. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shortsightedness with which the social-justice left embraces
hate speech laws and other restrictions on free expression can only
be chalked up to an extreme hubris, a belief that not only are they
on the right side of history culturally and morally but that
politically, things will never change either. Which seems unlikely.
Ten years ago Karl Rove envisioned — and people (my young self
included) legitimately feared — a "permanent Republican
majority" <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/10/03/republicans-are-shifting-on-social-issue">built
largely on socially-conservative concerns</a> like opposition
to same-sex marriage. LOL. Now even Michele Bachmann finds fighting
marriage equality <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/27/michele-bachmann-boring_n_5890646.html">"boring"</a> and
the most compelling conservative candidate is the one calling
for <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/10/03/rand-paul-i-dont-want-my-guns-registered">criminal
justice reform</a> instead of "traditional marriage." 
<!-- MORE --></p>
<p>Some see the takeaway here as progressivism having "won." But I
think it's more realistically illustrative of the fickle nature of
public opinion and party platforms. No, I don't see U.S. society
going backward on things like gay rights. But look at the
anti-abortion movement. Feminists thought they had abortion access
locked in — and in fact, the country continues to trend in favor of
abortion rights — but a loud, persistent, and passionate
anti-abortion minority has managed to get more laws restricting
abortion passed in the past few years than in the decades
before.</p>
<p>When you're winning the culture wars, it tends to radicalize and
mobilize the opposition. Even if U.S. society as a whole continues
to become more liberal or libertarian, we'll still face folks who
believe in the need for more authoritarianism, less gender
equality, and less tolerance. Some of them will inevitably go into
politics, law enforcement, and education. Some will become
legislators. Prosecutors. Judges. City council members. School
administrators. Police officers. Professors. And some will
inevitably have wildly different conceptions of what constitutes
"hate" or "obscenity" or "civility" than you or I may.</p>
<p>(...) It's not just a formal deference or fetishistic attachment
to the Constitution that leads libertarians to push for very
narrowly-written and interpreted speech restrictions. It's because
this framework provides a means for free speech to be meaningful
without regard to fickle cultural norms or prevailing political
power.</p>

W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 2003. He is widely seen as
the swing vote on the panel, with one judge a likely vote to strike
down the state bans on same-sex marriage (Martha Craig Daughtrey)
and one judge likely to uphold them (Debra L. Cook)." Thus,
Carpenter notes, "the next step in the controversy over same-sex
marriage likely depends on Sutton."</p>
<p>How might Judge Sutton vote? Carpenter argues that there is a
real chance he will lead the 6th Circuit in upholding the gay
marriage bans, thereby creating "a circuit split, practically
guaranteeing review in the Supreme Court." Carpenter explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Sixth Circuit could write a decision rebutting the numerous
constitutional grounds for same-sex marriage, including equal
protection and due process. It could try to explain why encouraging
opposite-sex couples to procreate responsibly depends on excluding
same-sex couples from marriage. It could try to clarify why
children are best raised in homes where their parents are married
while the parents of their best friends are not. It could hold that
despite a history of horrendous and invidious discrimination the
courts should not view anti-gay discrimination with any special
suspicion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sutton might also uphold the gay marriage bans as an act of
judicial deference, the legal philosophy which says that the courts
should give lawmakers the benefit of the doubt and therefore rarely
strike down democratically enacted statutes. After all, the last
time Sutton found himself at the center of a roiling national
debate over the wisdom of a controversial piece of legislation, he
voted to sustain the law in part on those very grounds.</p>
<p>What case was that? It was Sutton's 2011 opinion in <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0168p-06.pdf"><em>Thomas
More Law Center v. Obama</em></a>, in which the 6th Circuit upheld
the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act, aka Obamacare. According to Sutton, the great legal battle
over President Obama<em>'</em>s health care law is "just as
stirring, no less essential to the appropriate role of the National
Government and no less capable of political resolution" than the
debate over the constitutionality of the Second Bank of the United
States at issue in <em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em> (1819). And in
that foundational case, Sutton observed, "the Supreme Court erred
on the side of allowing the political branches to resolve the
conflict." Similarly, he declared, the fate of Obamacare should be
decided by "the peoples' political representatives, rather than
their judges."</p>
<p>Many gay marriage advocates were surprised and disappointed this
week when the Supreme Court <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/10/06/supreme-court-refuses-to-hear-gay-marria">
refused</a> to take up any new gay marriage cases. Judge Sutton may
soon provide the circuit split that SCOTUS (and everyone else) is
waiting for.</p>		</div>

<p>Nearly four out of five Americans, 78 percent, say Congress
should return to Capitol Hill before the November elections to hold
a vote on the authorization for use of military force against
Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq, the latest Reason-Rupe
national telephone poll finds.&#160; Just 16 percent of Americans
say Congress should not return to Washington before November to
hold a vote on military action in Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>When asked why Congress didn’t vote on the authorization of
military force before leaving for recess, 63 percent of Americans
say members of Congress don’t want to put their vote on the
official record, 15 percent say Congress doesn’t believe President
Obama needs its authorization for military action, and 8 percent
feel Congress simply didn’t have enough time to hold the vote.</p>
<p>Two-thirds, 66 percent, of Americans tell Reason-Rupe they
support the US airstrikes against Islamic State (ISIS) fighters in
Syria and Iraq.&#160; Fifty-eight percent of Americans believe US
ground troops would be necessary to defeat ISIS but only 43 percent
currently support sending US ground troops to fight in Syria and
Iraq, while 52 percent oppose.</p>
<p>There is even less support for arming Syrian rebels — 35 percent
of Americans favor, and 55 percent oppose supplying Syrian rebels
with US weapons to fight ISIS.&#160; That opposition could stem
from the fear that those weapons will eventually be used against
Americans. The public estimates there is a 78 percent chance that
weapons provided to Syrian rebels will ultimately be used against
America or its allies.</p>
<p><span><strong>Paying for the War Against
ISIS</strong></span></p>
<p>When asked, open-ended, how long they expect the current
military action against ISIS to last, the median answer was two
years.</p>
<p>When it comes to paying for the war against ISIS, the public is
split between raising taxes and cutting spending. To fund the
military action, 42 percent of Americans say they’d raise taxes —
34 percent would increase taxes only on the wealthy and another 8
percent would raise taxes on everyone.&#160; Nearly the same
amount, 39 percent, favor cutting spending — 35 percent want to cut
general federal spending and an additional 4 percent want to cut
entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Six percent
of Americans prefer borrowing money to pay for the war.&#160;</p>
<p>Reason-Rupe asked Americans what federal spending they’d cut
first to pay for the war against ISIS — 19 percent would start with
cuts to social safety net programs like food stamps and
unemployment insurance; 17 percent would reduce infrastructure and
transportation spending; 9 percent would cut science and medical
research; 7 percent would cut Social Security or Medicare; 3
percent would decrease education spending; and 2 percent would cut
veterans programs. Twenty-three percent selected a variety of minor
programs not presented as options and 16 percent said they didn’t
know which program they’d cut.</p>
<p><span><strong>Comparing Bush and Obama and Revisionist History
on the Iraq War</strong></span></p>
<p>While the Iraq war was very popular when it was launched, a
majority of Americans, 51 percent, now say they recall being
opposed to the war in 2003. Just 39 percent say they supported the
war in Iraq when it started in 2003. By comparison, a March 2003
national Pew survey found that 72 percent supported the US war in
Iraq.</p>
<p>Eighty-three percent of Americans think the war in Iraq has
either increased the threat of terrorism (38 percent) or didn’t
make a difference (45 percent) on the amount of terrorism, while 14
percent believe the war in Iraq reduced the threat of
terrorism.</p>
<p>Reason-Rupe finds the number of Americans who say President
Obama is doing a better job than President George W. Bush on
foreign policy increased slightly from 32 percent in September 2013
to 35 percent in October 2014. One-third of Americans say Obama is
doing a worse job than his predecessor and 28 percent say he is
doing no better or worse.&#160;</p>
<p><span><strong>Approval Ratings for President Obama,
Congress</strong></span></p>
<p>Thirty-eight percent of Americans approve of the way President
Obama is handling foreign policy, 51 percent disapprove.</p>
<p>Overall, 43 percent of Americans approve of the job President
Obama is doing, while 50 percent disapprove.</p>
<p>Congress’ approval rating is 19 percent, with 73 percent
disapproving.</p>
<p><span><strong>Midterm Elections</strong></span></p>
<p>Forty-two percent of registered voters say they’ll vote for the
Democratic congressional candidate in their district, while 33
percent say they’ll vote for the Republican candidate and 13
percent suggest they’ll vote for a third party or independent
candidate.</p>
<p>About half of voters, 53 percent, are satisfied with the US
House and US Senate candidates they have to choose from. That
satisfaction grows to 57 percent for state-level candidates and 63
percent for candidates running for local offices. &#160;</p>
<p><span><strong>Ebola and Vaccinations</strong></span></p>
<p>Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the
United States, died on Wednesday.&#160; In August 2014, 40 percent
of Americans thought an Ebola outbreak in the United States was
likely. Now, 62 percent of Americans tell Reason-Rupe an Ebola
outbreak in a US city is likely, while 36 percent say an outbreak
in the US is not likely. Twenty-three percent of the public
believes an Ebola outbreak in a US city is “very likely” and 39
percent say it is “somewhat likely.”&#160;</p>
<p>Six in 10 Americans believe all children should be required to
receive vaccinations for diseases like mumps and measles, while 37
percent feel parents should be able to refuse vaccinations.
&#160;Just over half, 52 percent, of Americans, say unvaccinated
children should not be allowed to attend public schools, 44 percent
think children who haven’t been vaccinated should be allowed in
schools.</p>
<p><span><strong>Mandatory Minimums and Voting Rights for Drug
Offenders</strong></span></p>
<p>Nearly eight in 10 Americans, 77 percent, favor eliminating
mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. And 73
percent favor restoring voting rights for nonviolent drug offenders
who have served their sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Police Favorability, Misconduct</strong></p>
<p>Seventy-two percent of Americans have a favorable view of the
police, down from 78 percent in April 2014.&#160; With several
police incidents in the news recently, 47 percent of Americans say
police officers are using excessive force more than they have in
the past, while 43 percent say the number of excessive force cases
aren’t going up or down.</p>
<p>When officers are guilty of misconduct, 50 percent of Americans
believe they are held accountable, while 45 percent do not believe
police officers are held accountable for their
misconduct.&#160;</p>
<p>Seven in 10 Americans oppose the use of racial profiling by
police officers. Forty-five percent of Americans believe the
criminal justice system treats whites, African-Americans and
Hispanics equally, while 44 percent think the criminal system
treats whites more fairly than it treats blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p><span><strong>About the Reason-Rupe Poll</strong></span></p>
<p>The Reason-Rupe poll interviewed 1,004 adults on mobile (503)
and landline (501) phones from October 1-6, 2014. The poll’s margin
of error is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. Princeton Survey
Research Associates International executed the nationwide
survey.</p>		</div>

and a little while later he was being pepper sprayed by cops who
said the teen, a black foster child in a white home, didn’t belong
there. What happened? <a href="http://abc11.com/340724/">ABC 11 in
Raleigh reports:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fuquay-Varina police said when a neighbor saw DeShawn walk in;
they called 911 to report a break-in. Soon, three officers were
inside the house, all to DeShawn's surprise.</p>
<p>"They was like, 'Put your hands on the door,'" said DeShawn. "I
was like, 'For what? This is my house.' I was like, 'Why are y'all
in here?'"</p>
<p>DeShawn said he became angry when officers pointed out the
pictures of the Tyler's three younger children on the mantle,
assuming he didn't belong there. An argument ensued and DeShawn
said one of the officers pepper-sprayed him in the face.</p>
<p>By the time Stacy came home, EMS were treating DeShawn in the
driveway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Police claim Currie threatened them and refused to obey orders,
and that criminal activity had recently taken place in the
neighborhood.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wtvd/docs/F-V%20Complete%20Police%20Report-308%20England%20Avenue.pdf">
police report</a> (PDF), a responding officer says he and two other
cops came into the house through an open door in the garage and
then “made contact” with Currie in the living room. According to
the police report, the first thing cops told Currie was to show
them his hands. After asking whether he lived there, they frisked
him. According to the report, after that police found Currie’s ID
(the report doesn’t say if they found it while frisking him or
asked him for it), which had a different address than the home.</p>
<p>The reporting officer claims Currie told another cop to stop
yelling at him or he would beat him up, and that he heard Currie
yelling for cops to get off him and when of the cop yelling
“spray!” while he was searching the upstairs of the home.</p>
<p>Currie’s foster parents reportedly met with the police captain
but no charges were filed one way or the other.</p>		</div>

<p><img alt="Rancho Cordova" height="150" src="http://cloudfront-media.reason.com/mc/2014_10/Rancho.jpg.jpg?h=150&amp;w=200" title="Think of the children ||| CBS local" width="200" style="float: right;" />Rancho Cordova, California, students are up in
arms—so to speak—about a gun range moving in next door to their
high school. The range is indoor—no stray bullets will be pelting
classroom windows—but students, teachers, and administrators all
believe the mere presence of a gun club so close to a school is
inherently dangerous.</p>
<p>Why? I have no earthly idea.</p>
<p>The community's explanation is an insistent <em>it just
is!</em> From <a href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/10/07/rancho-cordova-students-faculty-protest-proposed-gun-range-250-feet-from-school/">
cbslocal.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Students from George Washington Carver High protested what is
already on its way.</p>
<p>“Even though it’s legal, it’s still wrong. you shouldn’t mix
schools with guns,” said student Damon Kalerkorinos.</p>
<p>He helped organized the protest of students against the new
shooting range being developed just about 250 feet away from their
campus.</p>
<p>“It’s just not safe to have a gun club so close to a
school,” he said.</p>
<p>Principal Allegra Allesandri says a new gun club so close is
wrong, citing weapon-free zones designed to keep schools safe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But weapons-free zones <em>don't</em> make schools any
safer than they already are; people who intend to commit violence
in schools won't be deterred by felony weapons charges. Instead,
Allesandri and Kalerkorinos must have some unfounded belief that
mere proximity to a gun causes otherwise healthy people to lose
their minds and resort to violence. There isn't any merit to that
argument, either.</p>
<p>At least city authorities recognize that since the area is zoned
as an industrial district, the gun range has every right to set up
shop next to George Washington Carver High. Case closed? Not
quite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the project goes forward, protesters’ concerns haven’t
fallen on deaf ears as the city announced it will likely review its
planning codes.</p>
<p>“We’ll be looking at the gun-related uses as well as well as
other uses and compatibilities related to schools,” he said.</p>
<p>For the students and neighbors against the project, the hope is
that planning codes change statewide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like the city will consider restricting future gun
ranges, if not the one next to George Washington Carver High. The
local news story spins this as a beneficial lesson in participatory
democracy for the high schoolers. True enough, I suppose. If
nothing else, they learned that when it comes to politics and
governance, think-of-the-children paranoia trumps property rights
every single time.</p>		</div>

Carter's cheek. ||| Holyoke Publishing" width="300" style="float: right;" />When it comes to immigration
policy, the best-known clash between federal and lower levels of
government is the recent battle over Arizona's infamous <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2012/04/23/arizona-immigration-law-arguments-come-a">
SB 1070</a>, a law that intensified the border clampdown. And there
have been plenty of other times a <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2006/01/17/federalism-in-a-dubious-cause">state</a>
or <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2006/07/10/nativist-town-usa">city</a> has
tried to be more heavy-handed in its immigration enforcement than
the feds. But sometimes it's the more local jurisdiction that's
less eager to crack down, as Emily Badger <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/10/08/why-more-and-more-cities-are-refusing-to-help-the-government-deport-immigrants/">
points out</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chicago doesn't <a href="http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/06_-_chicago_ordinance.pdf">cooperate</a>.
Neither does <a href="http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/philadelphia_executive_order.pdf">
Philadelphia</a>. Nor <a href="http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/baltimore.pdf">Baltimore</a>,
<a href="http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/san_diego_county.pdf">San
Diego</a>, <a href="http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/14_-_newark_policy.pdf">Newark</a>,
<a href="http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/11_-_milwaukee_resolution.pdf">
Milwaukee,</a> <a href="http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/10_-_miami-dade_resolution.pdf">
Miami-Dade</a> or <a href="http://www.ilrc.org/files/documents/denver_county.pdf">Denver</a>.</p>
<p>One by one, these cities—soon to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/nyc-council-bill-challenges-detainment-orders-1412251202">be
joined by New York City</a>—have passed resolutions or enacted new
policies refusing to hand over immigrants detained by local police
to federal officials for deportation. The strategy, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/immigration/la-na-ff-immigration-holds-20141005-story.html">gaining
further momentum this year</a> with a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights-prisoners-rights/all-colorado-jails-now-reject-federal-immigration-detainers">statewide
law in Colorado</a>, is one way local governments dismayed by a
broken federal immigration system have found to undermine it.</p>
<p>At issue are what are called "immigration detainers." The
federal government relies on local law enforcement agencies to help
identify individuals for deportation. When local police come in
contact with suspected immigrants (for reasons
ranging <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/333/">from
serious offenses to traffic violations</a>), Immigration and
Customs Enforcement often issue a detainer, asking local jails and
prisons to hold them for 48 hours or more beyond their release to
give the feds time to decide if they want to collect and deport
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Badger mentions civil libertarian objections to the
imprisonments, and she also notes fears that these detentions will
undermine other sorts of police work. (People tend to be less
likely to help a homicide investigation if they're afraid they'll
be hauled in on immigration charges.) But the most important
incentive that she identifies might be the financial one: "The
federal government doesn't reimburse local agencies for resources
they spend 'holding' suspected immigrants on ICE's behalf." Just as
governors with no ideological objection to regulation can suddenly
sound like fire-breathing libertarians when confronted with an
unfunded mandate, ICE's orders can turn a moderate's thoughts
toward defiance.</p>

<p><em><img alt="" height="188" src="http://cloudfront-media.reason.com/mc/zevans@reason.com/Justin-Amash-credit-foter-Gage-Skidmore-cc-by-sa.jpg?h=188&amp;w=250" title="||| Gage-Skidmore-cc-by-sa" width="250" style="float: right;" />Washingtonian</em> magazine this week released
its fifteenth biennial survey on the best and worst of all the
Congresscritters roaming our great nation's swampy capital.</p>
<p>The publication <a href="http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/the-best-worst-of-congress-2014/">
takes a jab</a> at them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite approval ratings lower than Vladimir Putin's, the men
and women of the 113th Congress have continued to debate,
investigate, raise funds, and campaign with ebullience. Seeing as
little if any legislation arises from their activities, it's
apparent that if there are winners and losers, hits and misses, the
average citizen isn't privy to the scorecard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, the survey is conducted not among the great unwashed of
the American public, but among the aides of these lawmakers.</p>
<p>Most of the categories have a total of four spots, two for each
house. For example, the "meanest" in the Senate are 1. Barbara
Mikulski (D-Md.) and 2. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), and in the House are
1. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.) and 2. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.).</p>
<p>However, one category, Lobbyists' Worst Enemy, has a lone
representative: Justin Amash (R-Mich.). The libertarian-leaning
congressman, who posts on Facebook detailed explanations of all of
his votes in the House, succinctly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/repjustinamash">commented</a> on his
distinction: "Hmm."</p>
<p>Conspicuously below him in the Lobbyists' Best Friend category
were two other Republicans: 1. Eric Cantor (Va.) and 2. John
Boehner (Ohio).</p>
<p><img alt="" height="188" src="http://cloudfront-assets.reason.com/assets/db/14025120299072.jpg" title="||| " width="250" style="float: right;" />Of course, Cantor's biggest
distinction this year was <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/06/11/why-did-gop-house-majority-leader-eric-c#comment">
losing his primary</a>. He is the first sitting House majority
leader ever to manage that. <em>Washingtonian</em> notes that the
survey was handed out just after his loss. Cantor resigned in
August but bounced right into an investment bank gig worth $3.4
million.</p>
<p>As for Boehner, <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/218725-conservatives-plot-to-oust-the-speaker">
rumors</a> have long swirled that fellow Republicans are going to
try to oust him from his Speaker position.</p>
<p>Some other interesting highlights from the poll include Sen.
Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who earned spots in the Rising Star, Best
Speaker, Surprise Standout (whatever that means), and Most Likely
to Run for President (with competition only from Marco Rubio
(R-Fla.).</p>
<p>On the other hand, presidential hopeful Ted Cruz (R-Tex.)
"earned… a variety of dubious distinctions in our survey, including
showhorse, clueless, and most disappointing—and that was just from
Republicans," explains <em>Washingtonian</em>.</p>

Secretary Jay Carney <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/04/14/jay-carney-communist-propaganda-connoiss">

<p>Notably missing, however, are all the politicians who should
fill out the list. I'll start with the most clownish (and eminent)
of all clown-show pols: Vice-President Joe Biden, <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-10-07/joe-biden-apology-tour-hits-saudi-arabia">
who is currently managing to alienate</a> virtually every country

27, 2009, Denver cops pounded on the door of a home that <em>used
to</em> be a drug den and brothel. Not having kept their
information current, the cops didn't know the house was now
occupied by Daniel Martinez Jr. (pictured) and his family. They
also "had no warrant, no application for a warrant, nothing," as
the family's attorney <a href="http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2014/09/martinez_family_lawsuit_jury_award_police_raid.php">
later described</a> the scene. The officers rushed inside and
roughed up the residents, including shoving a 16-year-old boy's
head through a window and and dealing out a generous dollop of
beatings and bodyslamming.</p>
<p>Then they realized they'd fucked up. So they trumped up charges
against the family.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a jury saw through the cops' bullshit and found
Nathan Martinez and Daniel Martinez III not guilty of misdemeanor
assault charges. Subsequently, the district attorney saw the light
and abandoned the case against Daniel Martinez Jr. and Jonathan
Martinez.</p>
<p>Now the Martinez family is getting some payback after suing the
cops and their employers.</p>
<p>From Kirk Mitchell at <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/News/ci_26614491/Denver-jury-awards-18-million-to-family-in-wrongful-prosecution-case"><em>The
Denver Post</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Denver jury on Friday awarded $1.8 million to a family after a
wrongful prosecution case in which police officers executed a
warrantless raid on a home previously occupied by drug dealers and
prostitutes.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in 2011 against the city and county of
Denver and four police officers. Claims against the city later were
dropped in a summary judgment.</p>
<p>A jury of 10 awarded various amounts to the four family members
based on different amounts of damages attributed to the four
officers. The jury awarded a total of $1.25 million of punitive
damages collectively to the family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The family also alleged excessive force, but the jury in the
lawsuit couldn't come to a decision on that allegation. The
ultimate payout, if it survives the officers' promised appeals,
could add up to $3 million including interest and attorney's
fee.</p>		</div>

<p><img alt="" height="188" src="http://cloudfront-media.reason.com/mc/precleared/Ebola-CDC.jpg?h=188&amp;w=250" title="||| Credit: CDC" width="250" style="float: right;" />Assume the
following dire scenario: You become infected with Ebola and are
quarantined by U.S. medical officials. A promising new experimental
drug is in the works, but it hasn't yet received final approval.
You want to try the drug but the authorities won't let you. Do you
have a constitutional right to try to preserve your life by taking
the experimental drug? Most Americans would probably say
<em>yes</em>. But according to a prominent federal court, the
answer is <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>In 2007 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit ruled against a group of terminally ill cancer patients who
were suing the FDA in order to gain access to experimental drugs
that had the potential to save their lives. According to the D.C.
Circuit's ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Abigail+Alliance+for+Better+Access+to+Developmental+Drugs+v.+Eschenbach&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33&amp;case=65130678330936984&amp;scilh=0">
<em>Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v.
Eschenbach</em></a>, however, nothing in the Constitution protects
"a fundamental right of access for the terminally ill to
experimental drugs."</p>
<p>Writing in dissent, Judge Judith Ann Rogers, joined by Chief
Judge Douglas Ginsburg, attacked the majority’s "startling"
decision and its "stunning misunderstanding of the stakes" involved
for the terminally ill. "To deny the constitutional importance of
the right to life and to attempt to preserve life is to move from
judicial modesty to judicial abdication, as well as confusion,"
Rogers and Ginsburg declared.</p>
<p>Despite the strength of that dissent and the many failings of
the majority opinion, however, the Supreme Court refused to take
the case on appeal. The D.C. Circuit's ruling remains on the
books.</p>
