It ensures the continuation of critical services the American people depend on. And it brings us closer to returning the budget process to regular order.</p>
<p>Passage of this legislation ensures that we have appropriations for every agency in the Federal government, enabling them to more efficiently and effectively serve the American people and bringing greater certainty to businesses and communities across the country. Key areas that are positively impacted by the legislation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		<strong>Early Learning:&nbsp;</strong>The legislation fully restores funding cuts to the Head Start program that were caused by sequestration and provides dedicated resources to improve early education by supporting State efforts to expand preschool for 4-year olds.&nbsp; And the legislation provides additional funding to expand access to high-quality early education for tens of thousands of additional children through the launch of Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Health Care:</strong>&nbsp;The legislation helps ensure we can continue to move forward in providing quality, affordable health care for millions of Americans through implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act improves many aspects of the Nation&#39;s health care system, such as preventing those with pre-existing conditions from being dropped or denied coverage.&nbsp; It also provides tax credits to help pay for coverage and slows the growth of health care costs.</li>
<li>
		<strong>College Affordability:&nbsp;</strong>Funding is included to help bolster American competitiveness by supporting the development of innovative strategies to make college more affordable and help more students graduate on time with high-quality degrees that lead to good jobs.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Gun Safety:&nbsp;</strong>The legislation supports the Administration&rsquo;s efforts to strengthen school safety and mental health initiatives to help protect our children from gun violence and provide those suffering from mental illness with the treatment they need.&nbsp; It also includes funding for the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative, which will fund pilot sites for school districts to develop and implement innovative approaches to school safety.
<!--break--><!--break--></li>
<li>
		<strong>Commodity Futures Trading Commission:</strong>&nbsp;The legislation supports efforts to help create a more stable and responsible financial system.&nbsp; For example, funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a key Administration priority critical to the continued implementation of Wall Street Reform, is increased for the first time since 2011.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Energy Efficiency and Clean Energy:&nbsp;</strong>Resources are provided for critical Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) activities in the pursuit of clean energy and energy efficiency technology at lower costs and to advance U.S. competitiveness.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Infrastructure Investment:</strong>&nbsp;Communities across the country will benefit from increased Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants, which support infrastructure connecting people to new jobs and opportunities.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Research and Development:</strong>&nbsp;The Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Standards and Technology, the National Science Foundation, NASA and other key science agencies are provided resources for critical investments in health research, basic science, and innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This legislation represents an important compromise between Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp; But there is much more we can and should be doing to strengthen the economy and support working class families.&nbsp; Most immediately, we should restore unemployment insurance for more than one million Americans fighting to find a job.</p>
<p>Since the President took office in 2009, we have experienced the fastest decline in the deficit over a sustained period since the end of WWII. We need to continue this progress, but our top priority right now needs to be on efforts that will continue to grow the economy, create more jobs, and ensure that everyone benefits from a prosperous American economy.</p>

<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs sends the majority of outpatient prescriptions to patients via mail. Currently, in order for Veterans to track the delivery of mailed prescription medications they must call their local VA Medical Center directly.&nbsp; Kenneth recommends saving pharmacy staff time and enhancing customer service by making the package tracking information available to Veterans online through the Veterans Health Administration&rsquo;s existing web-based portal, MyHealth<em>e</em>Vet.</p>
<p>Keeping with tradition, Kenneth will have the opportunity to meet with President Obama in person in the Oval Office to discuss his winning idea.&nbsp; Each of the finalists&rsquo; ideas will be incorporated in the President&rsquo;s Budget and all other submissions will be considered for potential inclusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These ideas alone won&rsquo;t solve our Nation&rsquo;s long-term fiscal challenges, but they represent common-sense steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our government and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.</p>
<p>We thank everyone who submitted ideas for this year&rsquo;s SAVE Award and congratulate our 2013 SAVE Award winner Kenneth Siehr.</p>

<p>When the President took office in 2009, payment error rates were on the rise.&nbsp; In fiscal year (FY) 2009, the improper payment rate was 5.42 percent.&nbsp; Since then, the Administration, working together with Congress, has significantly reduced improper payments by strengthening accountability and transparency through yearly reviews by agency inspectors general, and expanded audits for high priority programs.</p>
<p>As a result of this concerted effort, the improper payment rate declined to 3.53 percent in FY 2013 when factoring in Department of Defense commercial payments, compared to 3.74 percent in FY 2012 under the same accounting. Over the past year, we reduced improper payment rates in major programs across the government, including Medicaid, Medicare Advantage (Part C), Unemployment Insurance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP - Food Stamps), Pell Grants, and two Social Security programs &ndash; Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance.&nbsp; Furthermore, agencies recovered more than $22 billion in overpayments through payment recapture audits and other methods in FY 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In programs administered at the local level, the Federal government has been working directly with States to ensure that appropriate corrective actions are put in place to reduce improper payments.&nbsp; For example, through the Medicaid Integrity Program, Federal staff specializing in program integrity provide support to States in their efforts to combat Medicaid provider waste, fraud, and abuse.&nbsp; In other instances, Federal agencies have implemented innovative techniques to ensure that benefit payments are accurate.&nbsp; For example, the SSI program is using new methods to verify bank account balances and ensure beneficiaries meet program asset thresholds.</p>
<p>The Administration is also advancing data analytics and improved technology to prevent improper payments before they happen.&nbsp; For example, in January 2013, the President signed into law the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act which reinforces and accelerates the Administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://donotpay.treas.gov/">Do Not Pay</a>&rdquo; efforts, requiring all Federal agencies to check the &ldquo;Do Not Pay&rdquo; list before issuing payments and awards.</p>
<p>OMB has also begun conducting a comprehensive analysis of agency-specific corrective actions to identify programs with the highest return-on-investment or potential for substantially reducing improper payments.&nbsp; This analysis will help shape guidance on improper payments to be released in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Improper payments represent an unacceptable waste of taxpayer resources. Moving forward, this Administration will continue its efforts to be effective stewards of taxpayer dollars by reducing improper payments and other instances of waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>

<p>The new uniform grants guidance improves on current policy by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Eliminating duplicative and conflicting guidance;</li>
<li>
		Focusing on performance over compliance for accountability;</li>
<li>
		Encouraging efficient use of information technology and shared services;</li>
<li>
		Providing for consistent and transparent treatment of costs;</li>
<li>
		Limiting allowable costs to make the best use of Federal resources;</li>
<li>
		Setting standard business processes using data definitions;</li>
<li>
		Encouraging non-Federal entities to have family-friendly policies;</li>
<li>
		Strengthening oversight; and</li>
<li>
		Targeting audit requirements on risk of waste, fraud, and abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guidance is the culmination of a two-year collaborative effort across the Federal government and its partners -- State and local governments, Indian tribes, research and higher education institutions, nonprofit organizations, and the audit community -- to rethink and reform the rules that govern our stewardship of Federal dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reform effort embodies principles set forth by the President, who directed OMB to work with key stakeholders to evaluate potential reforms to Federal grants policies in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-reducing-improper-payments">Executive Order 13520 on Reducing Improper Payments</a> and in the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/28/presidential-memorandum-administrative-flexibility">Presidential Memorandum on Administrative Flexibility, Lower Costs, and Better Results for State, Local, and Tribal Governments</a>. &nbsp;In addition, OMB and its partners are continuing complementary work to strengthen program outcomes through innovative and effective use of grant-making models, performance metrics, and evaluation, as described in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-17.pdf">OMB Memorandum M-13-17 on Next Steps in the Evidence and Innovation Agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, implementation of the new guidance will be spearheaded by the cross-agency Council on Financial Assistance Reform (COFAR), which worked closely with OMB on its development. &nbsp;The COFAR will work with stakeholders to facilitate implementation, evaluate effectiveness, and keep this important reform effort moving forward.&nbsp; We still have more to do, but we&rsquo;re proud to announce these changes.&nbsp; For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.cfo.gov/COFAR">www.cfo.gov/COFAR</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the last five years, Federal employees have submitted tens of thousands of ideas through the SAVE Award on how to curb unnecessary spending and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations.</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s&nbsp;winning idea came from Frederick Winter of the Department of Education, who proposed that all Federal employees who receive public transit benefits shift from regular transit fare to the reduced senior fare as soon as they are eligible.&nbsp; Fred&rsquo;s idea, along with other SAVE Award proposals, was included in the President&rsquo;s FY 2014 Budget.</p>
<p>Today, we are pleased to announce the finalists for the 2013 SAVE Award. Keeping with tradition, the winner will present his or her idea to the President in the Oval Office, and other proposals will be directed to agencies for potential action or inclusion in the President&rsquo;s FY 2015 Budget.</p>
<p>With today&rsquo;s announcement, public voting begins to select this year&rsquo;s winner.&nbsp; Voting can be done through the White House website at: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/save-award">www.whitehouse.gov/save-award</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the 2013 finalists:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.saveaward.gov/"><strong>Kenneth Siehr</strong>, <strong>Online Tracking of Veterans Mail Prescription Deliveries</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The Department of Veterans Affairs sends the majority of outpatient prescriptions to patients via mail. Currently, in order for Veterans to track the delivery of mailed prescription medications they must call their local VA Medical Center directly.&nbsp; Kenneth recommends saving pharmacy staff time and enhancing customer service by making the package tracking information available to Veterans online through the Veterans Health Administration&rsquo;s existing web-based portal, MyHeatheVet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.saveaward.gov/"><strong>Patrick Mindiola</strong>, <strong>Electronic Passport Notification</strong></a>. The State Department sends thousands of Information Request Letters (IRLs) in response to passport applications via regular mail. These mailings delay the processing time for applications and result in unnecessary added costs. Patrick recommends saving time and money by responding via email first, requesting any additional information needed and asking the applicants to verify submitted information. Mail notifications would be used only when email addresses are missing or returned, or if no response is received.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.saveaward.gov/"><strong>Dirk Renner</strong>, <strong>Share Certifications Across Agencies</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Dirk has worked for multiple federal agencies and recently found out that his USDA Forest Service All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) training was not transferable to the Department of the Interior&rsquo;s Fish and Wildlife Service, where he now works.&nbsp; Dirk recommends allowing comparable agency certifications to transfer from agency to agency or between departments.&nbsp; This change would save time and reduce duplicative training and travel costs for employees across the government.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.saveaward.gov/"><strong>Buyar Hayrula</strong>, <strong>Collect Custom Fines and Penalties Online</strong><strong>.</strong></a>&nbsp; Buyar suggests creating a secure website to allow Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers and agriculture specialists to collect payments by credit card at land ports of entry.&nbsp; Currently, payment requests are often sent via mail when a cashier is not available. Automating this payment process would increase revenue collections and operational efficiencies at CBP while also helping reduce wait times for individuals entering the U.S. at land ports of entry. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have noted before, these ideas alone won&rsquo;t solve our Nation&rsquo;s fiscal challenges, but they represent common-sense ways to reduce costs and improve our government for the American people. Please take a moment to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/save-award">pick your favorite idea</a> from the list and help us select the winner of this year&rsquo;s SAVE Award.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the Executive Order and the Administration&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf" target="_blank">Open Data Policy</a>, all newly-generated government data are required to be made available in open, machine-readable formats, which greatly enhances their accessibility and usefulness while continuing to ensure privacy and security.&nbsp;Federal agencies are also required to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 13.5pt;">
		<strong>Create a Single Agency Data Inventory.</strong>&nbsp;Agencies are required to catalogue their data assets, just like they would inventory computers or desk chairs, to better manage and use these resources.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 13.5pt;">
		<strong>Publish a Public Data Listing</strong>. On their agency.gov/data pages, agencies are required to publish a list of their data assets that are public, or could be made public.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 13.5pt;">
		<strong>Develop New Public Feedback Mechanisms</strong>. Agencies are required to set up feedback mechanisms to engage the public about where agencies should focus open data efforts, such as facilitating and prioritizing the release of datasets. Agencies are also required to identify public points of contacts for agency datasets.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is still much more work to do, we are excited to see the great progress being made by Federal agencies to unleash the power of open data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over a dozen agencies have launched webpages at agency.gov/data, making it easier for the public to find, understand, and use government data.&nbsp; Many agencies have released&mdash;and will continue to release&mdash;new datasets, which are now available both on agencies&rsquo; public data webpages and on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/" target="_blank">Data.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Federal agencies are also working to put processes in place to manage data more strategically. In fact, over 15 agencies have launched data working groups inside their agency to improve coordination around data management, data security and protection, and data release efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some examples of agency-specific efforts include:</p>

<p>Here at OSTP and OMB, we are also working to help agencies adopt the Administration&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo/" target="_blank">Open Data Policy</a>&nbsp;to unlock the potential of government data. We have made additional resources available to help Federal agencies make data&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2013opendata.pdf" target="_blank">open and available in machine-readable form</a>, including&nbsp;<a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/implementation-guide/" target="_blank">guidance</a>&nbsp;to agencies about how to inventory and publish their data assets, as well as free code, software tools, and case studies that any agency can use or add to, are available at the&nbsp;<a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/" target="_blank">Project Open Data website</a>.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration, which administers Data.gov, also continues to make improvements to the website. Check out&nbsp;<a href="http://next.data.gov/">Next.data.gov</a>&mdash;a design prototype of the next generation of Data.gov. We are eager to hear your thoughts about how to make it even better. You can provide feedback about the proposed design and functionality via&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/usdatagov" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.quora.com/Government/How-should-we-continue-to-improve-Data-gov" target="_blank">Quora</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/GSA/data.gov/" target="_blank">Github</a>, or by sending an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.data.gov/contact-us" target="_blank">email</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responsibly making government data open and widely reusable is good for the American people and our economy. We look forward to continuing the work ahead to increase access to our Nation&rsquo;s valuable information resources, to improve government transparency and efficiency, and to fuel economic growth.</p>

Today, OMB is releasing a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/reports/impacts-and-costs-of-october-2013-federal-government-shutdown-report.pdf">report</a> that catalogs the breadth and depth of this damage, and details the various impacts and costs of the October 2013 Federal government shutdown.</p>
<p>The report explains in detail the economic, budgetary, and programmatic costs of the shutdown.&nbsp;These costs include economic disruption, negative impacts on Federal programs and services that support American businesses and individuals, costs to the government, and impacts on the Federal workforce.</p>
<p>While the report covers a variety of areas, it highlights five key impacts and costs.</p>
<p>First, <u>Federal employees were furloughed for a combined total of 6.6 million days</u>, more than in any previous government shutdown. At its peak, about 850,000 individuals per day were furloughed. That number fell once most Department of Defense civilian employees were able to return to work as the Pentagon implemented the Pay Our Military Act.</p>
<p>Second, <u>the shutdown cost the Federal government billions of dollars</u>. The payroll cost of furloughed employee salaries alone &ndash; that is, the lost productivity of furloughed workers &ndash; was $2.0 billion. Beyond this, the Federal government also incurred other direct costs as a result of the shutdown. Fees went uncollected; IRS enforcement and other program integrity measures were halted; and the Federal government had to pay additional interest on payments that were late because of the shutdown.</p>
<p>Third, <u>the shutdown had significant negative effects on the economy</u>. The Council of Economic Advisers has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/weekly_indicators_report_final_0.pdf">estimated</a> that the combination of the shutdown and debt limit brinksmanship resulted in 120,000 fewer private sector jobs created during the first two weeks of October. And multiple surveys have shown that consumer and business confidence was badly damaged.</p>
<p>The report highlights some of the more direct impacts the shutdown had on the economy by shutting down government services. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Federal permitting and environmental and other reviews were halted, delaying job-creating transportation and energy projects.</li>
<li>
		Import and export licenses and applications were put on hold, negatively impacting trade.</li>
<li>
		Federal loans to small businesses, homeowners, and families in rural communities were put on hold.</li>
<li>
		Private-sector lending to individuals and small businesses was disrupted, because banks and lenders couldn&rsquo;t access government income and Social Security Number verification services.</li>
<li>
		Travel and tourism was disrupted at national parks and monuments across the country, hurting the surrounding local economies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fourth, <u>the shutdown impacted millions of Americans who rely on critical programs and services</u> halted by the shutdown. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Hundreds of patients were prevented from enrolling in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health.</li>
<li>
		Almost $4 billion in tax refunds were delayed.</li>
<li>
		Agencies from the Food and Drug Administration to the Environmental Protection Agency had to cancel health and safety inspections, while the National Transportation Safety Board was unable to investigate airplane accidents in a timely fashion.</li>
<li>
		Critical government-sponsored scientific research was put on hold. Notably, four of the five Nobel prize winning scientists who work for the Federal government were furloughed during the shutdown.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Fifth, <u>the shutdown could have a long-term impact on our ability to attract and retain the skilled and driven workforce that the Federal government needs</u>.&nbsp;The shutdown followed a three-year pay freeze for Federal employees, cuts in training and support, and, for hundreds of thousands of workers, administrative furloughs earlier this year because of sequestration. These cuts will make it harder for the government to attract and retain the talent it needs to provide top level service to the American people.</p>
<p>The report makes clear that the costs and impacts of the shutdown were significant and widespread, and demonstrates why this type of self-inflicted wound should not occur again.</p>

<p>At the same time, in response to public and stakeholder interest in SCC values, OMB&rsquo;s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) will provide a new opportunity for public comment on the estimates in addition to the public comment opportunities already available through particular rulemakings. Details on this public comment process will be published soon in the Federal Register.</p>
<p>The estimate of the SCC has been developed over many years, using the best science available, and with input from the public. Rigorous evaluation of costs and benefits is a core tenet of the rulemaking process. It is particularly important in the area of climate change, which is already imposing tangible costs through impacts that include an increase in prolonged periods of excessively high temperatures, more heavy downpours, an increase in wildfires, more severe droughts, permafrost thawing, ocean acidification, and sea-level rise. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February 2010, after considering public comments on interim values that agencies used in a number of rules, an interagency group of technical experts, coordinated by OMB and the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), released improved SCC estimates. The interagency group estimated the improved SCC values using the most widely cited climate economic impact models. Those climate impact models, known as integrated assessment models, were developed by outside experts and published in the peer-reviewed literature. &nbsp;Recognizing that the models underlying the SCC estimates would evolve and improve over time as scientific and economic understanding increased, the Administration committed in 2010 to regular updates of these estimates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May of this year, after all three of the underlying models were updated and used in peer-reviewed literature, and agencies received public comments urging them to update their estimates, the interagency group released revised SCC values. The May 2013 estimates reflect values that are similar to those used by other governments, international institutions, and major corporations. Those estimates have been out for public comment in several proposed rulemakings since May, and agencies have already received comments that are under review.</p>
<p>The technical corrections to the May SCC values that we are issuing today represent the best available science and data on the economic impacts on society of climate change. We will continue to work to refine these estimates to ensure that agencies are appropriately measuring the social cost of carbon emissions as they evaluate the costs and benefits of rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/deficitchart_v2_0.jpg" style="width: 553px; height: 536px" /></p>
<p>The President believes that growing our economy and creating more good jobs with higher wages must be our top economic priority.&nbsp; That is why he has consistently advocated a strategy to strengthen the middle class while improving our nation&rsquo;s long-term fiscal position by cutting the deficit in a balanced way.&nbsp; Under the President&#39;s leadership, we have already locked in more than $2.5 trillion of deficit reduction over the next decade, through a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases from asking the wealthiest to pay their share.</p>
<p>	In his 2014 Budget, the President presented a plan that would make critical investments to strengthen the middle class, create jobs, and grow the economy, while continuing to cut the deficit in a balanced way. It is a plan that demonstrates that we do not need to choose between growing the economy and taking further action to reduce the deficit &ndash; we can do both.&nbsp; Building on the $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction already locked in, the President&rsquo;s plan&nbsp;would replace the economically damaging sequester while achieving additional deficit reduction to put Federal debt on a downward path as a share of the economy. And unlike sequestration, which includes no long-term deficit reduction, the President&rsquo;s plan includes structural reforms that would generate growing savings in the second decade and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<!--break--><!--break--><p>The significant decrease in the deficit from last year was due to a combination of higher receipts and lower outlays in 2013, which can be attributed to a variety of factors, including a stronger economy, the expiration of certain tax cuts for high income Americans, and spending reductions like those achieved from the troop drawdown in Afghanistan as proposed in the President&rsquo;s Budget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward, the Administration remains committed to working with Congress to enact proposals that will strengthen the economy and middle class by making needed investments in areas like education, infrastructure, research and development, and national security, while putting debt as a share of the economy on a downward path.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet splashed across local news broadcasts last week were images of empty chairs sitting outside Head Start centers.&nbsp; Each chair represented a child denied the chance at a strong start to his or her future due to the cuts imposed by sequestration.</p>
<p>According to new <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/ohs_sequestration_by_state.pdf">state-by-states estimates</a> released by the Department of Health and Human Services, approximately 57,000 children are being cut from Head Start this year because of sequestration. That includes more than 51,000 fewer children in Head Start and nearly 6,000 fewer children, families, and pregnant women in Early Head Start.</p>
<p>If we continue to disinvest in our children and their futures, the harmful effects could last a lifetime. We need to get back on a path of smart investments in areas like early learning, which research has shown to be effective in improving school performance and putting students on the path to higher-paying jobs. &nbsp;This is particularly true for low-income children, who often start kindergarten academically behind their peers by many months, though early education is valuable for middle-class families as well.</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s FY 2014 Budget proposes <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/education.pdf">a fully-paid for initiative</a> to make high quality preschool available to all four-year olds, the creation of new Early Head Start-Child Care partnerships, and the extension and expansion of evidence-based voluntary home visiting services. &nbsp;Together, these investments will help provide children with a strong foundation for success in school and in life.</p>

<p>	Today, we are building on this effort by releasing additional resources to help Federal agencies make data <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2013opendata.pdf" target="_blank">open and available in machine-readable form</a>. Specifically, we are releasing <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/implementation-guide/" target="_blank">additional guidance</a> to agencies about how to inventory and publish their data assets, new <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/federal-awards-faq/" target="_blank">FAQs</a> about how open data requirements apply to Federal acquisition and grant-making processes, and a <a href="http://goals.performance.gov/opendata" target="_blank">framework for creating measurable goals</a> that agencies can use to track progress. All of this is openly available on the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/" target="_blank">Project Open Data</a> website, where additional case studies and free software tools for the agencies are also available.</p>
<p>	Opening up a wide range of government data means more entrepreneurs and companies using those data to create tools that help Americans find the right health care provider, identify a college that provides good value, find a safe place to live, and much more. It also empowers decision makers within government, giving them access to more information to enable smarter, data-driven decisions.&nbsp; Responsibly making government data open and widely reusable is good for the American people, and good for the American economy.</p>
<p>And to make it easier for the public and entrepreneurs to find, understand, and use open government data, we&rsquo;re working to improve the central website about US government data &ndash; check out <a href="http://next.data.gov/" target="_blank">Next.Data.gov</a> &ndash; a design prototype of the next generation of Data.gov.

They work for small businesses and large; many are small business owners in their own right. They put in long days on the road.&nbsp; And at the beginning and end of every one of those days, they have to inspect their trucks and file a report&mdash;even if they don&rsquo;t find any problems.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lot of paperwork&mdash;about 50 million hours per year, if you add up all the daily inspection reports filed by drivers across the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But due to an initiative that President Obama launched in 2011 to eliminate unnecessary regulation, that&rsquo;s about to change. Last week, the Department of Transportation announced a proposed rule that would ensure that drivers only have to file reports when they identify vehicle problems or have reason to think that problems might exist.&nbsp; Drivers will still make inspections to ensure safety on the road, but they will no longer need to file reports when there&rsquo;s nothing to report. &nbsp;If finalized, this rule could save truckers, businesses, and American consumers $1.7 billion dollars annually in paperwork costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, it is my job to review Federal agency regulations before they are issued.&nbsp; Regulations are critical to protecting our health, safety, and environment. But some regulations that were well crafted when first issued can become unnecessary over time as conditions change&mdash;and regulations that aren&rsquo;t providing real benefits to society need to be streamlined, modified, or repealed.&nbsp; No one should be filing paperwork just for the sake of filing paperwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why President Obama, in January 2011, issued an Executive Order that called on agencies to streamline, modify, or repeal regulations on the books that impose unnecessary burdens or costs.&nbsp; And he has since followed up with additional orders asking agencies to report regularly on their progress in reviewing existing rules, and asking independent agencies to perform a similar review of regulations on their books.</p>
<p>This regulatory retrospective review, or &ldquo;lookback,&rdquo; initiative is producing real results&mdash;and last week&rsquo;s Department of Transportation announcement is only one example.&nbsp; More than two dozen agencies have produced review plans, and almost twenty independent agencies have also done so, addressing hundreds of rules across the government. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a small fraction of the retrospective review rules already finalized will save around ten billion dollars for the American public in the near term. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) removed unnecessary regulatory and reporting requirements on hospitals and other healthcare providers, saving more than $5 billion over the next five years.&nbsp; And the Department of Labor (DOL) simplified and improved hazard warnings for workers, producing net benefits of more than $2.5 billion over the next five years, while strengthening worker safety. &nbsp;Notably, many of the agency review efforts focus especially on benefitting small businesses, which are crucial engines of growth in our economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the President launched this initiative in 2011, he stated that &ldquo;We can make our economy stronger and more competitive, while meeting our fundamental responsibilities to one another.&rdquo;&nbsp; That statement is as true today as it was back then.&nbsp; Review of existing regulations is a crucial part of ensuring that protecting our nation&rsquo;s health, safety, and environment remains consistent with creating jobs and prosperity. This Administration will expand and further institutionalize our regulatory lookback efforts to ensure that we continue to identify rules that need to be modified, streamlined, or repealed.&nbsp; And we will continue to carefully consider ideas and input from the public as we make these regulatory changes.&nbsp; After all, no one should face unnecessary red tape.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not good for truck drivers; it&rsquo;s not good for the economy; and it&rsquo;s not good for the American people.</p>

And today,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/08/05/ask-president-obama-your-questions-about-housing">the President will answer questions</a> submitted by homeowners, renters, and prospective buyers during a live conversation with the real estate site Zillow.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	For most Americans, buying a home is the largest purchase of their lives. That&rsquo;s where a company like Zillow comes in -- helping families make informed decisions about buying a home and where to raise a family. Zillow is powered, in part, by open government data &ndash; including freely available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Census Bureau. Zillow uses these data sets to do things like help home buyers in a given region understand the point in years at which buying a home is more financially advantageous than renting the same home.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Making government data resources publicly available in machine-readable form as fuel for new private-sector products and businesses is one example of how the President is working&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/07/08/smarter-more-innovative-government-american-people">to make government smarter and more innovative</a>&nbsp;for the American people.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	In May, the President issued a landmark Executive Order,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-">Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information</a>, and took&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/09/landmark-steps-liberate-open-data">historic steps</a>&nbsp;to make large-scale additional government data resources publicly accessible, findable and usable. As the President said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to help launch more start-ups. It&rsquo;s going to help launch more businesses. It&rsquo;s going to help more entrepreneurs come up with products and services that we haven&rsquo;t even imagined yet.&rdquo;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We&rsquo;re excited about what innovative companies like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trulia.com/">Trulia</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.estately.com/">Estately</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.redfin.com/">Redfin</a>, and others have done and can do with open government data to help people looking for the right homes for their families. This is innovation born of the potent combination of open data and private sector entrepreneurship &ndash; innovation that helps Americans and creates jobs.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Borne out of the President&rsquo;s belief that the best ideas often come from those on the front lines, Federal employees have submitted more than 85,000 ideas over the last four years through the SAVE Award. Recommendations have ranged from implementing new measures that conserve energy to eliminating paper copies of publications that are available online to using ground shipping instead of next-day service when mailing non-urgent packages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These simple, yet innovative ideas are already making a difference. The President&rsquo;s last four budgets have included over 80 SAVE Award proposals that are saving hundreds of millions of dollars and improving the way government operates. We know these ideas alone won&rsquo;t solve the Nation&rsquo;s long-term fiscal challenges, but they represent common-sense steps to improve government and provide a better value to the American people.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re a Federal employee, go to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/save-award">www.WhiteHouse.gov/save-award</a> and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/save-award">send us your idea</a> on how to save money and create efficiencies within your agency and across government. And everyone else, stay tuned. We&rsquo;ll be looking to you in the next few months to help us pick a winner!</p>

The Administration strongly supports voluntary efforts by the private sector to reduce infringement and we welcome the initiative brought forward by the companies to establish industry-wide standards to combat online piracy and counterfeiting by reducing financial incentives associated with infringement. We believe that this is a positive step and that such efforts can have a significant impact on reducing online piracy and counterfeiting.</p>
<p>It is critical that such efforts be undertaken in a manner that is consistent with all applicable laws and with the Administration&rsquo;s broader Internet policy principles emphasizing privacy, free speech, fair process, and competition. We encourage the companies participating to continue to work with all interested stakeholders, including creators, rightholders, and public interest groups, to ensure that their practices are transparent and fully consistent with the democratic values that have helped the Internet to flourish. We also encourage other participants in the online advertising space to consider adopting voluntary initiatives that protect ad networks, publishers, advertisers, creators, rightholders, and above all, consumers.</p>
<p>The Administration is committed to reducing infringement of American intellectual property. We will continue to pursue a comprehensive approach to the problems associated with infringement, including increased law enforcement, educational awareness, and increased cooperation with our trading partners in order to promote innovation, support jobs, increase exports, and maintain our global competitiveness.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s news is a good example of how the public and private sector can work to combat piracy and counterfeiting while protecting and, in fact, further encourage the innovation made possible by an open Internet.</p>

<p>To help meet that challenge, the White House gathered a diverse array of leaders from the private sector, nonprofits, philanthropy, academia, and federal, state and local government to advance one of the ways that this Administration is thinking outside the box &ndash; &ldquo;Pay for Success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pay for Success offers innovative ways for the government to partner with philanthropic and private investors to fund proven and promising practices, significantly enhancing the return on taxpayer investments. Under this model, these organizations provide the up-front capital for social services with a strong evidence base that, when successful, achieve measurable outcomes that improve the lives of families and individuals and reduce their need for future services.&nbsp;Government pays when these measurable results are achieved.</p>
<p>For example, the Department of Labor has launched a Pay for Success competition through the Workforce Innovation Fund designed to model new and more effective strategies for delivering workforce development and preventive social services that cut across existing program siloes, increase job placement and improve job retention.</p>
<!--break--><!--break--><p>In the Fiscal Year <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov//omb/budget">2014 Budget</a>, President Obama proposed a nearly $500 million investment in Pay for Success, including the creation of a new $300 million Incentive Fund at the Treasury Department.&nbsp;The Fund is designed to empower cities, states and nonprofits to support more public-private partnerships that produce measurable results in their communities.</p>
<p>In addition to the Incentive Fund, another $195 million is proposed to support Pay for Success programming in nine programs across three different Federal agencies: the Departments of Labor, Justice and Education.</p>
<p>The White House Pay for Success convening highlighted examples of innovative work underway at state and local levels across a wide array of sectors including workforce development, reducing recidivism, homelessness, aging, asthma management, disability and early childhood education. Currently, Pay for Success efforts are in some form of development in at least 14 states across the nation and that number continues to grow.</p>
<p>Pay for Success is a promising strategy for scaling programs that work and enhancing the return on taxpayer dollars in new, measurable ways. It is certainly one way this Administration is working to build a smarter, more innovative government for the American people.</p>

<p>The MSR shows that the projected deficit in 2013 has decreased by more than $200 billion as compared to the projection included in the Budget.&nbsp; The 2013 deficit is now projected to be 4.7 percent of GDP.&nbsp; That is down from a deficit of 10.1 percent four years ago &ndash; representing the fastest period of deficit reduction since the years immediately following World War II.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going forward, the MSR shows that, under the President&rsquo;s Budget, deficits will be reduced to below 3 percent of GDP by 2017 and continue to fall to about 2 percent in 2023.&nbsp; Importantly, the MSR also shows that the Budget achieves a core goal of fiscal sustainability by putting Federal debt on a declining path as a share of the economy.</p>
<p>The President believes our top priority must be strengthening the true engine of economic growth &ndash; a rising and thriving middle class.&nbsp; He will continue to pursue policies to accelerate the recovery, speed job creation, and expand the middle class.&nbsp; The 2014 Budget demonstrates that we do not need to choose between making critical investments necessary to help grow our economy and support middle class families and continuing to cut the deficit in a balanced way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To once again make America a magnet for jobs, the Budget invests in high-tech manufacturing and innovation, clean energy, and infrastructure, while cutting red tape to help businesses grow.&nbsp; To give workers the skills they need to compete in the global economy, it invests in education and job training, and sets forth a visionary proposal to ensure every four-year-old has access to high quality pre-school.&nbsp; To ensure hard work is rewarded, it builds ladders of opportunity to help every American and every community. By identifying offsets for each of these initiatives, the Budget invests in the potential of the middle class and our economy while keeping us on a fiscally disciplined long-term path.</p>
<p>The Budget includes more than enough deficit reduction to replace the economically damaging sequester while exceeding the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction and putting our debt on a downward path as a share of the economy. And unlike sequestration, which includes zero long-term deficit reduction, the President&rsquo;s plan includes structural reforms that will generate growing savings in the second decade and beyond.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s top priority must be spurring job creation and strengthening the middle class. The President&rsquo;s Budget embodies these goals and charts a path to a stronger economy and a more secure fiscal future for the years to come.</p>

<p>One of the President&rsquo;s first priorities after taking office in 2009 was to bring a government built for the 20th century into the 21st century. Over the last four years, we&rsquo;ve made great progress to advance this goal, thanks in large part to the integration of new technologies and innovations across the Administration.</p>
<p>This morning, the President held a meeting with his Cabinet and senior officials to lay out his vision for building a better, smarter, faster government over the course of his second term. During the meeting, the President directed Cabinet members and key officials in his Administration to build on the progress made over the first term, and he challenged us to improve government even further.</p>
<p>To help members of the Cabinet and Administration officials find more innovative ways to deliver better results, the Administration recently welcomed a second class of <a href="http://whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> &ndash; 43 highly talented and motivated individuals chosen out of more than 2,000 applicants. The first class of 18 Presidential Innovation Fellows worked hand-in-hand with top government innovators to develop solutions that are delivering smart-government solutions to taxpayers at a lower cost.</p>

<p>Today, President Obama highlighted innovations taking place in our government that are already making a difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		<strong>Digitizing disaster recovery: FEMA use of data analytics and internet/mobile apps to deliver better results</strong>:&nbsp; In response to Hurricane Sandy and the Oklahoma tornadoes, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) partnered with the U.S.Geological Survey, Civil Air Patrol, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&nbsp;to utilize imagery and data that identified inaccessible and destroyed homes, which enabled FEMA to expedite assistance funds to eligible applicants. FEMA has also succeeded in getting 304,000 survivors (57% of applicants) registered for assistance following Hurricane Sandy through internet and smartphone apps. The FEMA disaster recovery app also tell users how to assemble basic emergency kits and help them locate disaster recovery centers and apply for financial assistance following a disaster. This has enabled better, faster service delivered at lower costs.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Ushering out old technologies, bringing in new:</strong> The Administration has eliminated duplicative systems and accelerated the adoption of new technology used by agencies through &ldquo;PortfolioStat&rdquo;&mdash;a comprehensive look at agencies&rsquo; IT portfolios to identify savings. To date, the initiative has identified more than $2.5 billion in cost reductions. &nbsp;Read more about this effort in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/03/27/portfoliostat-20-driving-better-management-and-efficiency-federal-it">this blog post</a>.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Opening government data to fuel innovation and problem-solving: </strong>For the first time in history, the Administration opened up huge amounts of government data to the American people, and put it on the internet for free. At <a href="http://data.gov">Data.gov</a>, you can search through and download more than 75,000 data sets &ndash; data on everything from what different hospitals charge for different procedures, to credit card complaints, to weather and climate measurements. And entrepreneurs and business owners are using that data to create jobs and solve problems that government can&rsquo;t solve by itself.&nbsp; Learn more about the Open Data Initiative in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/09/landmark-steps-liberate-open-data">this blog post</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This morning, the President stated, &ldquo;We need the brightest minds to help solve our biggest challenges. In this democracy, we, the people, realize this government is ours. It&rsquo;s up to each and every one of us to make it work better. And we all have a stake in our success.&rdquo; Read&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/08/remarks-president-presenting-new-management-agenda">the President&rsquo;s full remarks here</a>, and <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/152498343/The-Management-Agenda-for-Government-Innovation">see all the graphics</a> from his speech below.</p>

Today&rsquo;s release of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/IPEC/2013-us-ipec-joint-strategic-plan.pdf">the Administration&rsquo;s 2013 Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement</a> builds on our efforts to protect intellectual property to date, and provides a roadmap for our work over the next three years. In preparing the 2013 Joint Strategic Plan, we solicited public comment on how to improve our approach, and that public input was invaluable in drafting the final version of the Joint Strategic Plan. We will continue to seek public views on how to best promote and protect intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is a key driver of our economy. So it matters that we have the right approach to intellectual property enforcement; one that is thoughtful, dedicated and effective, and that makes good and efficient use of our resources.</p>
<p>Ours is a Nation of entrepreneurs, inventors, and artists. The ideas that American citizens generate catalyze cutting edge research, ensure longer and healthier lives, and power the globe&rsquo;s most productive economy. Our ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit make the United States great, and we must fiercely defend that competitive advantage. As President Obama has said, &ldquo;If the playing field is level, I promise you &ndash; America will always win.&rdquo;</p>
<!--break--><!--break--><p>Since the first Joint Strategic Plan was released in 2010, the Administration has made tremendous progress in intellectual property enforcement. Coordination and efficiency of the Federal agencies has improved; U.S law enforcement has increased significantly and we have successfully worked with Congress to improve our legislation. We have increased our focus on trade secret theft and economic espionage that give foreign governments and companies an unfair competitive advantage by stealing our technology. We have pressed our trading partners to do more to improve enforcement of all types of intellectual property. We have encouraged the private sector to do more on a voluntary basis to make online infringement less profitable as a business, consistent with due process, free speech, privacy interests of users, competition law and protecting legitimate uses of the Internet.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we remain committed to protecting intellectual property and are building on the approach set out in the original Strategy. For example, we will continue to look for ways to make enforcement as coordinated and efficient as possible. We will look for ways to further increase transparency and outreach to a broad range of interests and views. We will continue to encourage companies to take voluntary steps to reduce the profit incentive from online infringement, consistent with due process, free speech, privacy interests and competition law, and we will also encourage rightholders to agree to a set of best practices to reduce infringement online.</p>
<p>We will review our domestic legislation to make sure it is effective and up-to-date. We will look for ways to use technology better to make enforcement more efficient and targeted. We want to discourage infringement and encourage those that are appropriately building on the works of others to create new works, so we will educate authors on how fair use works to allow creation of new works. We will increase support for small and medium sized companies that are seeking to expand into foreign markets. And we will begin collecting information on labor conditions in the manufacture and distribution of counterfeit and pirated goods overseas.</p>
<p>These are just some of the important initiatives that are set forth in the Joint Strategic Plan &ndash; for a complete list of all items in the 2013 strategy, see page 10.</p>
<p>I want to highlight two areas where we are looking for additional public input. First, we want to make sure that enforcement of patents at the border is as efficient and transparent possible so <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=OMB-2013-0003">we are seeking views</a> on how to improve that process. Also we want to know if the voluntary initiatives we have encouraged to reduce online infringement are working well and having a positive impact. So to that end, today the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=PTO-C-2013-0036">asking the public for input</a> on the best way to assess the effectiveness of voluntary initiatives. I encourage you to let us know your views. Public input is critical to ensure that we maintain the right approach moving forward.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you to further enforce and protect American intellectual property rights. With continued leadership by the Administration and the support of Congress, the American people will continue to lead the world in innovation, and this innovation will continue to fuel our economy.</p>

The proposal builds on previous Administration proposals and language included in the President&rsquo;s Budget, and marks another important step in our ongoing effort to buy smarter and end wasteful, fiscally imprudent contract spending.</p>
<p>Under current law, contractors that are paid based on their incurred costs (which represents about one-third of current contract spending) may demand reimbursement for executive salaries, bonuses and other compensation up to the level of the Nation&rsquo;s top private sector CEOs and other senior executives. This taxpayer reimbursement level has skyrocketed by more than 300 percent since the law was enacted in the mid-1990s. Taxpayers have been required, by law, to foot this unaffordable expense, despite the fact that this rapidly increasing cost has had little bearing on the value agencies receive under their government contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!--break--><!--break--></p>
<p>When the cap was raised to $693,000 for FY 2010, the President called on Congress to repeal the current statutory formula and replace it with a lower, more sensible limit that is on par with what the government pays its own executives and employees. The last Congress considered several reform proposals, but ultimately could only agree on a modest change that expanded application of the statutory cap for defense contractors from the contractor&rsquo;s senior executives to all of its employees.</p>
<p>As a result of Congressional inaction, the Administration was forced to raise the cap to $763,000 for FY 2011. In the coming weeks, the cap will need to be raised again for FY 2012 - this time to more than $950,000 - continuing down a path of cap increases that is far outpacing the growth of inflation and the wages of most of America&rsquo;s working families. This wasteful expenditure of taxpayer resources must stop.</p>
<p>The Administration&rsquo;s proposal calls on Congress to abolish the current formula and instead tie the reimbursement cap to the President&rsquo;s salary and apply it across-the-board to all defense and civilian cost-reimbursement contracts. Tying the cap to the President&rsquo;s salary provides a reasonable level of compensation for high value Federal contractors while ensuring taxpayers are not saddled with paying excessive compensation costs.</p>
<p>Importantly, the proposal provides for an exemption to the cap if, and only if, an agency determines such additional payment is necessary to ensure it has access to the specialized skills required to support mission requirements, such as for certain key scientists or engineers. And to be clear, nothing in the proposal limits the amount contractors pay their executives. The cap only limits how much the government will reimburse the contractors for the services of those executives. Taking these steps has the potential to save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over what they would have to pay if the cap remains unchanged.</p>
<p>This proposal is part of the President&rsquo;s broader Campaign to Cut Waste and the Administration&rsquo;s ongoing effort to eliminate inefficient spending in contracting &ndash; an effort that has resulted in a noteworthy decline in annual contract spending since the President took office in 2009. We hope that this Congress, unlike the last one, will heed the urgent call to restore fiscal responsibility before additional taxpayer dollars that could be used to fund critical agency mission work are wasted unnecessarily to pay for costly overhead in the form of excessive contractor compensation.</p>

<p>The Strategy is built on the proposition that all Americans should be able to access information from their Government anywhere, anytime, and on any device; that open government data - data that are publicly accessible in easy-to-use formats - can fuel innovation and economic growth; and that technology can make government more transparent, more efficient, and more effective.</p>
<!--break--><!--break--><p>A year later, there&rsquo;s a lot to be proud of:</p>
<p><strong>Information Centric</strong><br />
	In twelve months, the Federal Government has significantly shifted how it thinks about digital information - treating data as a valuable national asset that should be open and available to the public, to entrepreneurs, and others, instead of keeping it trapped in government systems.&nbsp; We jump-started this process by releasing hundreds of government datasets via machine-readable formats known as <a href="http://www.howto.gov/mobile/apis-in-government">application programming interfaces</a> (APIs). <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/digitalgov/apis">These APIs</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;which encompass datasets as varied as <a href="https://developers.buildingsapi.lbl.gov/">home and business energy trends </a>&nbsp;to <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/">real-time earthquake notifications</a>&nbsp;around the world - can be used by private-sector developers to create new applications and services. You can even access the <a href="http://marsweather.ingenology.com/">current weather on Mars</a>, transmitted from the Curiosity Rover. To facilitate the creation of new and useful digital tools, each agency released its own <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">developer pages</a>, and Data.gov launched a <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources#individual">government-wide API directory</a> to make these resources easier to find and use. Additionally, Data.gov transitioned its <a href="http://www.data.gov/blog/datagov-launches-new-catalog-and-apis">central catalog to an open source platform</a>, enabling automated aggregation of data directly from agencies&rsquo; websites to Data.gov. Finally, in a landmark action, the President recently released a historic <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-">Executive Order</a> and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf">Open Data Policy</a>, making open and machine-readable the new default for government data.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Platform</strong><br />
	The Federal Government and the American people cannot afford to have each agency build isolated and duplicative technology solutions. Instead, we must use modern platforms for digital services that can be shared across agencies. To maximize the value of our investments in technology, we launched a <a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/">Digital Services Innovation Center</a> that launched <a href="http://sites.usa.gov/">Sites.USA.gov</a> to help agencies build plug-and-play websites and created the <a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/get-it-done/mobile-application-development-program/">Mobile Application Development Program</a> to help agencies plan, test, develop and launch mobile apps. Additionally, the Administration is participating in <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">open source communities</a>, <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/results-and-data/progress-data/data/dca">using crowdsourcing</a>, and launching government-wide solutions to increase efficiencies. To leverage the government&rsquo;s buying power, we established a <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100931">government-wide mobile and wireless contract vehicle</a> that acts as a &ldquo;family plan&rdquo; for the Federal Government, which we anticipate will save taxpayers $300 million over the next five years. Through this vehicle and the new <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/159903">Managed Mobility Program at GSA</a>, agencies can better centralize management of devices and strengthen security of the government&rsquo;s mobile platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Customer-Centric</strong><br />
	Citizens shouldn&rsquo;t have to struggle to access the information they need. To ensure that the American people can easily find government services, we implemented a <a href="http://www.howto.gov/web-content/digital-metrics">government-wide Digital Analytics Program</a> across all Federal websites. That means for the first time, we have insight about what information the public is looking for, where they&rsquo;re looking for it, and if they&rsquo;re able to find it - essential to our goal of easing access to government information. We are also optimizing Federal websites for mobile devices and creating mobile apps to ensure government services are available to citizens anywhere, anytime and on any device. For example, the new <a href="http://apps.usa.gov/usajobs.shtml">USAJobs</a> app from the Office of Personnel Management makes it easier for job seekers to search and apply for jobs with their mobile devices, and the <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/saferbus/saferbus.aspx">SaferBus app</a> from the Department of Transportation allows users to access a bus company&rsquo;s safety performance record and file a complaint from their mobile devices. These are just two of the many <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/digitalgov/mobile">mobile products</a>&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve released as part of the Digital Government Strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Privacy</strong><br />
	Throughout all of these efforts, maintaining cyber security and protecting privacy have been paramount. Because mobile devices and wireless networks have unique security challenges, we published the first government-wide <a href="https://cio.gov/creating-a-foundation-for-mobile-security/">mobile and wireless security baseline</a>, to help agencies identify appropriate security solutions and share them across the Federal Government.</p>
<p>In the end, the digital strategy is all about connecting people to government resources in useful ways. And by &ldquo;connecting&rdquo; we mean a two-way street. We are counting on the public - developers, entrepreneurs and innovators - to join us, and be a part of the process. Together, we will continue to modernize government to respond to 21st Century opportunities.</p>

This means that states, local governments, and private developers will be able to start construction sooner, create jobs earlier, and fix our nation&rsquo;s infrastructure faster.</p>
<p>On March 22, 2012, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/22/executive-order-improving-performance-federal-permitting-and-review-infr">the President issued an Executive Order </a>launching a government-wide initiative to improve the efficiency of federal review and permitting of infrastructure projects. Since then, agencies have expedited the review and permitting of 50 major projects, including bridges, transit , railways, waterways, roads, and renewable energy projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Federal agencies have also identified a set of best practices for efficient review and permitting. Those range from expanding information technology (IT) tools to strategies - like simultaneous review - for improving collaboration. Today&rsquo;s Presidential Memorandum directs all relevant agencies to put these best practices into effect.</p>
<p>Cutting red tape and streamlining the process for making permitting decisions will help us meet the President&rsquo;s goal of cutting in half the timelines for major infrastructure projects, while creating better outcomes for our communities <em>and</em> for the environment.</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s initiative is already showing real results. For example, this afternoon, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/16/president-obama-headed-baltimore-learn-why">President Obama and Deputy Transportation Secretary John Porcari will visit Baltimore</a>, where we sped up the approval process for the city&rsquo;s Red Line rail transit corridor by six months.</p>
<p>We also recently expedited Federal approval for the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement project in New York. By speeding up the approval process, Federal agencies trimmed up to three years off the timeline for this multi-billion dollar project that will help put Americans back to work.</p>
<!--break--><!--break--><p>To learn more about the Administration&rsquo;s reform effort, you can read <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/22/executive-order-improving-performance-federal-permitting-and-review-infr">the President&rsquo;s 2012 Executive Order</a>, the <a href="http://www.permits.performance.gov/sites/all/themes/permits2/files/federal_plan.pdf">Federal Action Plan</a> describing what we are doing in more detail, and our <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/reports/report-to-the-president-rebuilding-americas-infrastructure.pdf">first annual Report to the President</a> on our progress so far. You can also track the results of specific projects on the <a href="http://www.permits.performance.gov/">Administration&#39;s Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard</a>, a new tool that provides an unprecedented level of transparency into the Federal permitting and review process.</p>
<p>Going forward, the Administration will make even more extensive use of performance tools like the Dashboard as we work to make the exceptional time savings achieved on the first 50 projects the norm. We are also working to expand innovative mitigation tools to improve environmental outcomes; develop more targeted and relevant environmental reviews; provide more opportunities for public input; and build on our first five regional pilot teams to improve collaboration with State, local, and Tribal governments.</p>
<p>This permitting modernization effort is an important component of the President&rsquo;s larger effort to grow the economy, accelerate job creation, and improve U.S. competitiveness by building a 21<sup>st</sup> Century infrastructure. Notably, the <a href="http://whitehouse.gov/omb/budget">President&rsquo;s 2014 Budget</a>&nbsp;calls for immediately investing $50 billion in our Nation&rsquo;s transportation infrastructure, with $40 billion devoted to &ldquo;fix-it-first&rdquo; projects that target areas in the most urgent need of repair. The President also proposed a &ldquo;Rebuild America Partnership,&rdquo; creating tools to encourage partnerships between the private sector and Federal, State, and local governments to enhance the role of private capital in U.S. infrastructure investment and ensure America has the best transportation, electric, water, and communications networks in the world.</p>

Note: This op-ed originally appeared in regional newspapers across the country.</em></p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s Fiscal Year 2014 Budget is a concrete plan to create jobs and cut the deficit. We do not need to choose between these two priorities. The President&rsquo;s balanced, compromise plan proves we can do both.</p>
<p>The guiding principle behind the President&rsquo;s plan is reigniting America&rsquo;s engine of economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class. The plan is focused on addressing three fundamental questions:&nbsp; How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do the jobs of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century? How do we make sure hard work leads to a decent living?&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make America once again a magnet for jobs, the Budget invests in high-tech manufacturing, clean energy, and infrastructure, laying the foundation for more rapid business growth. These investments will ensure that the jobs of the future are created in America and we stay on the cutting edge of innovation. To give workers the skills they need to compete in the global economy, it invests in education and job training, including a &ldquo;Preschool for All&rdquo; initiative to ensure children across the country are prepared to succeed. To ensure hard work leads to a decent living, it raises the minimum wage to $9.00 so an honest day&rsquo;s work pays more.</p>
<p>The Budget does all of these things as part of a comprehensive plan that cuts the deficit and puts the nation on a sound fiscal course. Every new initiative in the plan is fully paid for &ndash; not adding a single dime to the deficit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be clear, we have already made important progress in cutting the deficit. Over the past few years, Democrats and Republicans have cut the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion through a mix of spending cuts and raising income tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. This progress puts us more than halfway toward the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say is needed to put us on a fiscally sustainable path.</p>
<p>Now we need to finish the job. That is why the President stands by the compromise offer he made to House Speaker Boehner during &ldquo;fiscal cliff&rdquo; negotiations this past December. These proposals would achieve $1.8 trillion in additional deficit reduction over the next 10 years, bringing total deficit reduction to $4.3 trillion while replacing the damaging, arbitrary cuts of the sequester. This deficit reduction is comprised of more than $2 of spending cuts for every $1 of new revenue from closing tax loopholes and reducing tax breaks for the wealthiest. And it takes further steps to address the largest driver of long-term deficits &ndash; rising health care costs &ndash; by including $400 billion in health savings that crack down on waste and fraud and strengthen Medicare for years to come.</p>
<p>By including this compromise offer made to Speaker Boehner in the Budget, the President is demonstrating his willingness to make tough choices to find common ground to further reduce the deficit. This offer includes some difficult cuts that the President would not propose on their own, such as an adjustment to inflation indexing requested by Republicans. But there can be no sacred cows for either party.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Budget&rsquo;s deficit reduction proposals are designed to accelerate the recovery by replacing the damaging sequester and making smart investments in jobs, while protecting the most vulnerable &ndash; adhering to two key principles laid out in the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson Commission proposal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The House and Senate have now both passed budget proposals. By returning to the regular order process that members of Congress say they want, we are hopeful that a bipartisan agreement can be reached.</p>
<p>Our country continues to face significant fiscal and economic challenges. But they are surmountable. By working together, we have already made progress in reducing the deficit and restoring economic growth and job creation. The President&rsquo;s Budget provides a specific and responsible plan for continuing this progress.

<p>We appreciate GAO&rsquo;s work in these important areas. The Administration is strongly committed to reducing duplication and fragmentation and has worked hard over the last four years to make that happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From day one, the President has made rooting out waste and improving the way government works a top priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 2011, the President and Vice President launched the Campaign to Cut Waste, aimed at identifying and eliminating wasteful, inefficient or duplicative spending wherever it may exist in government.&nbsp; This initiative has already saved taxpayers billions of dollars. And, in February 2012 the President submitted a proposal to Congress to reinstate Presidential authority to reorganize Federal agencies to reduce the number of overlapping government programs, all with an eye towards eliminating duplication and making government more efficient.&nbsp; In addition, each year the President&rsquo;s Budget has included hundreds of proposals for ways to cut, consolidate or save money on programs that are inefficient, duplicative, or simply no longer needed, translating into hundreds of billions of dollars in savings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Budget that the President will release tomorrow goes even further, including 215 cuts, consolidations, and savings proposals, which are projected to save more than $25 billion in 2014.</p>
<p>We have examined the report GAO released today, and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/Building_a_21st_Century_Government_by_Cutting%20Duplication_Fragmentation_and_Waste">highlighted some of our efforts here</a>.</p>
<p>GAO&rsquo;s findings recognize the progress the Administration is making:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		GAO found that the Executive Branch and Congress, together, have made progress on 104 of the broad areas out of the 131 GAO has identified over the past two years.</li>
<li>
		In terms of the specific recommended actions within these broad areas, the Executive Branch has made progress on over 75% percent of the recommendations, with more than 20% fully addressed and at least another 55% percent partially addressed.&nbsp; The Executive Branch has fully addressed more than 50 actions and partially addressed more than 140 actions since 2011.</li>
<li>
		The GAO report also recognizes that there are many areas where additional action by Congress is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; GAO found that Congress has fully addressed about 20% of the recommendations for Congressional action since early 2011, and made progress on another 11%.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>By identifying specific actions which may help reduce duplication, achieve cost savings, or improve coordination across programs, GAO is helping to further these efforts to make government more effective and efficient. Many of the GAO recommendations deal with some of the most complex and challenging areas across the Federal government.&nbsp; Fully addressing them is a long-term process that in many cases will take many years to implement&ndash; a fact that GAO recognizes.&nbsp; Progress in other areas requires Congressional action.</p>
<p>Building on proposals in previous budgets, many of which were adopted by Congress, the President&rsquo;s 2014 budget offers several proposals to address some of the areas of duplication and overlap.&nbsp; For example, the budget will include proposals to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		<strong>Streamline Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) programs</strong> through a bold reorganization of STEM education programs into four key areas:&nbsp; K-12 instruction; undergraduate education; graduate fellowships; and informal education activities that typically take place outside the classroom.&nbsp; Currently, there are more than 220 STEM education programs spread across 13 agencies. The proposed reorganization would consolidate or restructure more than half of these programs and streamline functions across the agencies to improve the delivery and impact of STEM education.</li>
<li>
		<strong>Modernize, Streamline, and Strengthen the Delivery of Training and Employment Services. </strong>&nbsp;Today more than 40 Federal programs deliver job training and employment services. The Administration is exploring opportunities to make these programs even more effective, including by reorganizing some of the existing training programs to make it easier for Americans to find a job or build their skills for a better one, and for employers to find well-qualified workers.&nbsp; For example, the 2014 Budget proposes a universal displaced worker program that will reach more than a million workers a year with a set of core services, combining the best elements of two more narrowly-targeted programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage Congress to take quick action on these and other proposals included in the Budget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the President has said, to support an economy that is built to last, we need a government that&rsquo;s built for the 21st Century. We have made real progress toward that end and we look forward to working with Congress to enact the reforms proposed by the President to make our government work more effectively and efficiently for the American people.</p>

<p>In March 2012, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) initiated PortfolioStat. Agencies across the Federal government undertook a data-driven effort to examine their IT portfolios to identify common areas of spending with the goal of decreasing duplication and driving down costs. Through this process, agencies identified more than $2.5 billion in spending reductions that could be achieved from FY 2013 through FY 2015.</p>
<p>Today, Acting Director Jeff Zients and I <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-09.pdf">signed a memo</a> commencing this year&rsquo;s PortfolioStat process and outlining improvements from last year. PortfolioStat will be an ongoing effort, growing each year to incorporate lessons learned and changes in technology. The upgraded process streamlines agency data collection and improves analytics, consolidates the agency&rsquo;s strategic IT direction and management improvements into one central plan, and holds agencies accountable for the goals set through last year&rsquo;s process.</p>
<p>A key lesson learned is that agencies should evolve their IT portfolios to deliver IT &ldquo;as a service.&rdquo; Unlike traditional capital models where assets are purchased for individual projects, the service delivery model entails agencies deploying their IT like a business, optimizing it for consumption agency-wide. For example, with cloud computing solutions, agencies have a scalable and transparent way to provision IT services, giving agencies a viable enterprise alternative to often stove-piped, capital IT investments.</p>
<p>The results from PortfolioStat are already significant; by the end this month, we expect agencies to report savings of approximately $300 million. We are committed to continuing PortfolioStat to drive further management improvements, save billions of dollars across the Federal Government, and improve services to Americans through the use of technology.</p>

As the next step in this effort, today, OMB is issuing <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/financial/memos/implementation-of-freeze-the-footprint-guidance.pdf">guidance</a>&nbsp;to direct agencies to implement a &ldquo;Freeze the Footprint&rdquo; policy for Federal real estate.</p>
<p>Under today&rsquo;s new guidance, all CFO-act agencies are required to develop plans that will serve as the basis for agency actions to restrict the growth in their office and warehouse inventories. Agencies will also be required to develop internal controls related to square footage growth and facilitate increased communication between agency Chief Financial Officer and Real Property Management offices. These changes will further improve the management of the Federal Government&rsquo;s real property assets.</p>
<p>This effort builds upon on the Administration&rsquo;s ongoing work to sell unneeded Federal properties. For example, in October 2012, GSA sold the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant in Dallas for $357,500 and the Government was able to realize over $27 million in savings by requiring the new owner to complete the necessary environmental remediation. And in November 2012, GSA sold a 1.39 acre Norfolk, VA, multi-building property, that had been declared excess by the Department of Defense (DOD), to the City of Norfolk for $1.1 million to become administrative and training offices for the Norfolk Sheriff&#39;s Department. More information on these and other Federal properties that have been sold can be viewed on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/fiscal/excess-property-map">White House Excess Assets page</a>.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s guidance also expands on the President&rsquo;s 2010 directive to agencies to identify cost savings through better real estate management. In the directive, the President set an ambitious goal of eliminating $8 billion in real estate costs by 2012: $5 billion in savings through DOD&rsquo;s Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) process and $3 billion in non-BRAC savings. By the end of FY 2012 Federal agencies identified over $3.5 billion in non-BRAC real estate savings through disposals, space management, and sustainable energy and innovative real property management practices. In addition, DOD identified $5.1 billion in real-estate savings related to BRAC. An update on agency efforts to achieve the President&rsquo;s $8 billion goal is available on <a href="http://finance.performance.gov/initiative/manage-property/home">Performance.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Agencies have made tremendous progress in making their real estate inventories more efficient, however, we know there is still more work to be done. As we develop new initiatives to spur progress in managing Federal real estate, we will be incorporating &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; from the implementation of the President&rsquo;s goals to date. We look forward to further reducing the size and cost of the Government&rsquo;s real estate inventory in the years ahead.</p>

These goals are set in areas where the Administration aims to achieve accelerated performance improvement through focused senior leadership attention. Agency leaders have each set ambitious near-term, implementation-focused Priority Goals, and the Administration has chosen Cross-Agency Priority Goals focused on topics requiring the collaboration of multiple agencies. Each quarterly progress update will be posted on <u><a href="http://www.performance.gov/">Performance.gov</a></u>, providing a window into the Administration&rsquo;s efforts to make the government work smarter, better, and more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the Department of the Interior is working to authorize more production of clean energy on public lands. The agency set a goal that by September 30, 2013, it will increase the approved capacity for renewable energy (solar, wind, and geothermal) on or affecting public lands by at least 11,000 Megawatts relative to 2009 levels. By the end of 2012, it was fast approaching its goal, having approved 10,933 Megawatts, enough to power millions of homes.</p>
<p><!--break--><!--break--></p>
<p>The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are working together to help low-income families reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient.&nbsp; In 2009, DOE and HUD set a joint Priority Goal that between FY 2010 and FY 2013, they would enable cost-effective energy retrofits or energy efficient new construction of a total of 1.2 million housing units. DOE and HUD achieved this goal ahead of schedule, having completed retrofits of over 1.2 million homes by the end of the second quarter of FY 2012, saving these households hundreds of dollars each year in heating, cooling, and electricity costs.</p>
<p>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is making good progress toward the goal of reducing the global mortality rate for children under five. Its efforts have contributed to an estimated reduction of 2 deaths per 1,000 live births across USAID-assisted countries (from an estimated 73 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2011 to an estimated 71 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012).</p>
<p>Multiple agencies are cooperating to reach a goal of providing 4G wireless broadband coverage for 98 percent of Americans by 2016, to help provide a strong foundation for economic growth, job creation, and global competitiveness. As of June 2012, 81 percent of Americans have access to advanced wireless broadband and the ability to enjoy minimum download speeds of at least 6 megabits per second, up from 36 percent in mid-2010.&nbsp; When wired connections are included, the availability of 4G or comparable broadband speeds jumps to almost 96 percent of the population.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department is also making rapid progress in its efforts to increase electronic transactions to improve service, prevent fraud, and reduce costs. It has, for example, cut the number of paper claims from a high of 195.5 million in 2007 to 41 million in 2012. Treasury has also increased the individual tax&nbsp;e-File rate to 80 percent in 2012, beating its goal by one year.</p>
<p>While progress on these and other Priority Goals has generally been strong through the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2013, further progress may be slowed in selected areas if sequestration continues.&nbsp;To learn more about the Administration&rsquo;s Cross-Agency and Agency Priority goals, visit the <a href="http://goals.performance.gov/goals_2013">Clear Goals</a> section of Performance.gov.</p>

Trade secret theft can cripple a company&rsquo;s competitive advantage in foreign markets, diminish export prospects around the globe, and put American jobs in jeopardy. The President is committed to preventing the theft of corporate trade secrets. As he clearly expressed in his State of the Union Speech, &ldquo;we cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Strategy that we are releasing today coordinates and improves U.S. Government efforts to protect the innovation that drives the American economy and supports jobs in the United States. As the Strategy lays out, we are taking a whole of government approach to stop the theft of trade secrets by foreign competitors or foreign governments by any means &ndash; cyber or otherwise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
		First, we will increase our diplomatic engagement. Specifically, we will convey our concerns to countries where there are high incidents of trade secret theft with coordinated and sustained messages from the most senior levels of the Administration. We will build coalitions with countries that share our concerns to support our efforts. We will urge foreign law enforcement to do more. And we will use our trade policy tools to press other governments for better protection and enforcement.</li>
<li>
		Second, we will support industry-led efforts to develop best practices to protect trade secrets and encourage companies to share with each other best practices that can mitigate the risk of trade secret theft.</li>
<li>
		Third, DOJ will continue to make the investigation and prosecution of trade secret theft by foreign competitors and foreign governments a top priority. Additionally, the FBI and the intelligence community will provide warnings and threat assessments to the private sector on information and technology that are being targeted for theft by foreign competitors and foreign governments.</li>
<li>
		Fourth, President Obama recently signed two pieces of legislation that will improve enforcement against trade secret theft. But we need to continue to make sure our laws are as effective as possible. So, moving forward, we will conduct a review of our laws to determine if further changes are needed to enhance enforcement. If changes are necessary, we will work with Congress to make those changes lasting and comprehensive.</li>
<li>
		Lastly, we will increase public awareness of the threats and risks to the U.S. economy posed by trade secret theft.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that trade secrets play a crucial role in America&rsquo;s global competitiveness. As the Strategy makes clear, the Administration will continue to act vigorously to combat the theft of American trade secrets that could be used by foreign companies or foreign governments to gain an unfair commercial advantage over U.S. companies. In order to continue to lead, succeed, and prosper in the 21st Century global economy, we will use this Strategy to put in place an effective and coordinated approach to protect American trade secrets.</p>

This grant reform proposal entitled <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/02/01/2013-02113/reform-of-federal-policies-relating-to-grants-and-cooperative-agreements-cost-principles-and">&ldquo;Proposed Uniform Guidance: Cost Principles, Audit, and Administrative Requirements for Federal Awards,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;combines the multiple Federal regulations that currently govern the way we administer grants into a single, comprehensive and streamlined uniform policy guide.&nbsp; It is intended to both increase the efficiency and effectiveness of grant programs by eliminating unnecessary and duplicative requirements and strengthen the oversight of grant dollars by focusing on areas such as eligibility, monitoring of sub-recipients, adequate reporting, and other areas that are potential indices of waste, fraud or abuse.</p>
<p>The reforms in this proposal make further progress on implementing President Obama&rsquo;s November 2009 Executive Order 13520 on reducing improper payments and eliminating waste in Federal programs, and the February 2011 Presidential Memorandum on promoting administrative flexibility.&nbsp;Following OMB&rsquo;s February 2012 publication of potential grant reform ideas in the Federal Register, we received hundreds of comments and suggestions, which we carefully considered as we worked with the Council on Financial Assistance Reform to develop this proposal. We also worked collaboratively with stakeholder groups in the grants community to identify policies in need of clarification and simplification &ndash; with the goal of improving grant management, accountability, oversight, and overall performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="display: none">&nbsp;</span>Specific measures in the proposal include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		<span id="cke_bm_73S" style="display: none">&nbsp;</span>Harmonizing and streamlining all OMB guidance on grants from eight documents into one, while clarifying key differences for different entities;</li>
<li>
		Simplifying the reporting requirements that grantees must adhere to in justifying salaries and wages charged to grants;</li>
<li>
		Ensuring that Federal agencies better review financial risk posed by applicants and merits of an application before providing a grant;</li>
<li>
		Providing guidance to ensure robust oversight of sub-recipients;</li>
<li>
		Focusing more audit resources on preventing waste, fraud, and abuse; and</li>
<li>
		Holding agencies accountable for getting results and addressing weaknesses among grant recipients.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Administration believes these reforms will make a significant contribution to improving Federal grant-making and outcomes for the American people.&nbsp;And we welcome ideas to make them even better and encourage the public and stakeholders to go to Regulations.gov&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=OMB-2013-0001">docket OMB-2013-0001</a>)&nbsp;to review and comment on our proposal.</p>

Different organizations, ranging from the Bowles-Simpson Fiscal Commission to the House Budget Committee, have considered this current policy baseline to be the appropriate reference point, since it measures changes relative to the status quo, rather than the mix of expiring provisions and policy changes that would likely never be implemented.</p>
<p>CBO also recognizes the value in this &ldquo;current policy&rdquo; view and routinely publishes their interpretation, known as the Alternative Fiscal Scenario (AFS), which is regularly cited by lawmakers from both parties, including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan. The CBO current policy baseline assumes that the Bush tax cuts, the AMT patch, and expiring business tax provisions will be extended; that the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) cuts in payments to Medicare physicians will not take effect; and that the sequestration will be turned off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to &ldquo;current policy&rdquo; and based on estimates from the <a href="http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/American%20Taxpayer%20Relief%20Act.pdf">CBO</a> and the <a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4497">Joint Committee on Taxation</a> &ndash; Congress&rsquo;s official score-keeping bodies &ndash; we can see that H.R. 8 would reduce the deficit by $737 billion. Within that, it would reduce spending by $107 billion. The deficit reduction is comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		$618 billion due to higher taxes on the highest-income Americans and the wealthiest estates.</li>
<li>
		$22 billion due to reductions in discretionary spending and a change to tax-preferred savings accounts that pay for turning off sequestration for two months.</li>
<li>
		$24 billion in various health measures that pay for turning off the SGR for one year.&nbsp; (Because sequestration and the SGR are turned off in the CBO current policy baseline, these pay-fors reduce deficits relative to that baseline.)</li>
<li>
		The above provisions more than offset the $30 billion cost of the measure&rsquo;s one-year extension of emergency unemployment insurance benefits, resulting in $630 billion of net non-interest deficit reduction.</li>
<li>
		Another $104 billion of deficit reduction results from lower interest payments on the federal debt, for a total of $737 billion in deficit reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/communications/misc/cboscore_hr8_20130101.pdf">this table</a> for a more detailed breakdown.</p>
<p>So H.R. 8 not only keeps taxes low for the middle class, asks the wealthiest to pay their fair share, and helps the economy continue to grow, it also reduces the deficit by $737 billion under this more realistic scenario.</p>
