These &#8220;critiques&#8221; are vacuous and do nothing but demonstrate that the authors haven&#8217;t bothered to do basic research about what libertarians believe and why.</p>
<p>A recent example of this is Salon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/03/the_7_strangest_libertarian_ideas_partner/">list</a> of 7 strange libertarian ideas. Every single one misses the mark and requires only a limited response. More in depth information on these issues can easily be found with Google.</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;Parents should be allowed to let their children starve to death.&#8221;</li>
<p>First off, most libertarians don&#8217;t actually think this. The issue is a strawman.  Second off, even the people who believe that parents have no obligations to their children also believe that <em>other people</em> should be allowed to take custody of the neglected kids and care for them.</p>
<li>&#8220;We must deregulate companies like Uber, even when they cheat.&#8221;</li>
<p>Libertarians don&#8217;t think taxis should be regulated either.  So the idea that it&#8217;s unfair that Uber isn&#8217;t regulated while taxis are cuts the other way for us.  Nor does libertarian opposition to regulation imply approval of Uber interfering with Lyft&#8217;s business operations.  Rather, libertarians think that violations of terms of service should be private and not state matters.</p>
<li>&#8220;We should eliminate Social Security and Medicare.&#8221;</li>
<p>These are massive transfers of wealth from the young and poor to the old and rich.  We oppose them b/c we oppose intervention and wealth transfers (and the state in general).  Of course the practical way of getting rid of them does it in a way that phases them out without leaving the poor who do depend on them hanging.</p>
<li>&#8220;Society doesn’t have the right to enforce basic justice in public places of business.&#8221;</li>
<p>We believe that people have the right to do what they want as long as it doesn&#8217;t involve using aggression against others.  That doesn&#8217;t mean that we think racism is okay, it just means that we don&#8217;t think that a civilized response to racism is threatening to shoot the racist or to lock him in a cage against his will unless he does what we want.</p>
<p>Furthermore the argument Salon gives is wrong and circular.  Wrong b/c the constitution doesn&#8217;t apply to private citizens and so private acts of discrimination can&#8217;t be &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; (and for most of the country&#8217;s history, the constitution was read as <em>preventing</em> this kind of legislation).  Circular b/c you can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s &#8220;against federal law&#8221; when the argument is about whether such a federal law should exist in the first place.</p>
<p><span id="more-13544"></span></p>
<li>&#8220;Selflessness is vile.&#8221;</li>
<p>Objectivists go out of their way to make it clear that they aren&#8217;t libertarians.  This is one of the areas where they disagree with most of us.  Furthermore, Objectivists oppose altruism as a philosophical principle, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they oppose helping others. So in principle, they can support aid workers and organizations like Doctors Without Boarders; they just don&#8217;t think that you should support them out of a sense of obligation to others.</p>
<li>&#8220;Democracy is unacceptable, especially since we began feeding poor people and allowing women to vote.&#8221;</li>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really a libertarian issue.  Salon brings it up because Peter Thiel wrote about it in a blog post on Cato&#8217;s website. And while Thiel may support libertarianism financially, that doesn&#8217;t make him libertarian. I&#8217;ve never seen Thiel admit to being an anarcho-capitalist.  Instead I&#8217;ve seen him support a bunch of other approaches, many of which are discussed in the article Salon references.</p>
<p>As for the claim itself, the idea that our kind of representative democracy is fundamentally flawed goes back to ancient Greece. (The Athenians wouldn&#8217;t even call what we have a democracy).  Plenty of modern mainstream political scientists and public choice economists have written extensively about the structural problems with our democracy.  It&#8217;s ludicrous to pretend that well known and documented problems don&#8217;t exist.  It is similarly absurd to make it sound like someone is a racist or a misogynist for pointing out that all of these structural problems are exacerbated as the number of voters increases.</p>
<p>Finally, in wrapping up its criticism of Thiel, Salon raises the strawman that the state created the internet.  This is a popular myth.  The internet was created by mergers between a bunch of large private networks.  The government portion of the resulting network was relatively small.  (IBM alone had more computers than the entire government network.) But even if the state did create the internet, that doesn&#8217;t obligate future generations to support the state.  The British monarchy gave us the Magna Carta, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that we are obligated to stick with the government of medieval England for the rest of eternity.</p>
<li>&#8220;We can replace death with libertarianism.&#8221;</li>
<p>This has nothing whatsoever to do with libertarianism. Some people think that if economic growth goes far enough, we&#8217;ll have the technology to make immortality an affordable medical possibility.  They happen to support libertarianism because they think that it will lead to the kind of economic growth this development needs.</p>

And he&#8217;s also absolutely incorrect.</p>
<div>The War on (Some) Drugs is not a failed business strategy, and it is dangerous to even suggest that it is. Instead, it is a failed moral strategy. If it seems counter-intuitive to you that the government should be in the business of applying moral strategies, you win a prize. The control of what enters one&#8217;s body is, at root, the very basis of self-ownership. (Admittedly, the phrase &#8220;self-ownership&#8221; is not quite the correct nuance. I don&#8217;t &#8220;own&#8221; me, I &#8220;am&#8221; me, but anyway&#8230;)</p>
<div>The apparent failure of the War on (Some) Drugs speaks just as much to its actual goals as to its legitimate chances for success. In other words, if the goal was to criminalize large portions of an entire generation, then it has been a raging success. However, if the goal was to prevent people from freely consuming that which they know is their right anyway, it had no hope of success in the first place, and that lesson was obvious from alcohol prohibition.</p>
<div>On the more general issue of business strategies, why is it is dangerous to draw such a parallel to the War on (Some) Drugs? Such a suggestion&#8211;that just because the War on (Some) Drugs is failing that we should stop it&#8211;is a trap. It is a great example of <em>the argument from effect</em>, a veritable fat, shiny, Red Herring waiting for the obvious, &#8220;well, people still murder each other&#8230;&#8221; retort. Let us be clear, murdering someone is an attack on them, which is morally prohibited, dare I say <em>malum in se</em> anyway. Me putting a substance that you don&#8217;t like into my body has nothing to do with you.</p>
<div>Drug prohibition is unarguably <em>malum prohibitum</em> and therefore simply the attempt&#8211;misguided and puritanical&#8211;to impose the choices of some on the behavior of all. Ergo, it was destined for failure. By the way, this in no way suggests that drugs are good, but then again, neither are Twinkies. Now, if one wants to argue about the possible negative results of drug usage&#8211;crime, sickness, whatever&#8211;those ostensibly resultant actions, at least those that actually infringe on others, are ALREADY against the law. They are, in fact, <em>malum in se</em> regardless.</p>
<div>If you&#8217;re in your own home getting baked or shooting up, and don&#8217;t bother anyone else, it should be no one else&#8217;s business. I might also argue that most, if not all, of the crime supposedly endemic to illegal drugs occurs commensurate with the distribution of said substances despite their illegality. Make it legal on one day and that crime stops the next day. And, if the lessons of places like Portugal are any indication, with very little, if any, increase in widespread drug usage.</div>

The libertarian perspective has been discussed <a href="http://libertarianchristians.com/2014/03/30/the-libertarian-position-on-hobby-lobby">elsewhere</a>, but what the Court actually did is not being described accurately despite the fact that they helpfully include a &#8220;syllabus&#8221; summarizing each ruling for the public.  Apparently, some people, including many reporters, can&#8217;t be bothered to read even the summary.  Therefore in the interest of clarity, I will try to give a brief overview of the case and of the majority’s reasoning in their decision.  For the sake of brevity, citations are omitted because they can be found in the actual decision.</p>
<p>First some background.  Contrary to what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSQCH1qyIDo">some people</a> have claimed, objections to general laws on religious grounds <em>do</em> excuse you from having to follow them. This wasn’t always the case.  In the early 90s, the Supreme Court ruled that &#8220;neutral, generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even when not supported by a compelling governmental interest&#8221; because allowing someone to object on the basis of religion to such laws &#8220;would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.&#8221;  In response, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), overturning the Supreme Court’s decision and allowing challenges to neutral laws that burdened religious exercise. Under the RFRA, &#8220;[g]overnment shall not substantially burden a person&#8217;s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.&#8221; The people affected by such a burden are entitled to exemption from the rule unless the government &#8220;demonstrates that application of the burden to the person&#8211; (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many people have said that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), i.e. “Obamacare”, requires employers&#8217; group health plans to provide coverage of contraceptives.  This is not correct.  The ACA merely requires the plans to cover &#8220;preventive care and screenings&#8221; for women without &#8220;any cost sharing requirements.&#8221;  Congress left it up to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to decide specifically what types of care this includes.  When the HRSA issued regulations specifying what was required, they mandated that all FDA approved contraceptive methods be covered.  They also provided for a religious exemption for religious organizations and non-profit religious corporations.  Per the requirements of the RFRA, they apparently would also provide a similar exception to <em>unincorporated</em> for-profit businesses operating according to the owner’s religious principles.  They did not provide an exception for <em>incorporated</em> for-profit businesses with corporate policies stating that the businesses would be run according to religious principles.  Importantly, granting this exemption <em>does not</em> mean that the employees of these organizations will not have contraceptive coverage.  Rather, it means that the insurance companies and ultimately the government will provide this coverage at no cost to the employer or the employees.</p>
<p>Now for the case. <span id="more-13506"></span>  Because they were denied an exemption by the HRSA, three corporations, Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel, sued under the RFRA claiming that the regulations requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage burdened their owners&#8217; exercise of religion and consequently entitled the corporations to an exemption.  Because the RFRA is a federal statute and the requirement to provide contraceptive coverage is merely a regulation, the statute takes precedence.  Therefore, if it applies to these cases, the corporations are entitled to an exemption.  Because Conestoga is located in Pennsylvania, their case went to the 3rd Circuit.  Hobby Lobby and Mardel however are based in Oklahoma, and consequently their case went to the 10th Circuit.  These two appellate courts reached opposite conclusions.  The Supreme Court then agreed to hear the case to resolve the “circuit split” and ensure a uniform interpretation of the law.</p>
<p>Contrary to what has been widely reported, the central issue in the case was not about corporate personhood, but about whether a corporation can be said to “exercise religion” <em>on behalf of its owners</em>.  As we have explained <a href="http://libertarianstandard.com/2011/04/12/continued-confusion-over-the-rights-of-corporations/">multiple</a> <a href="http://libertarianstandard.com/2011/10/18/corporate-personhood-limited-liability-and-double-taxation/">times</a> on this website, a corporation is merely a legal fiction, a type of short-hand that makes explaining the law easier.  As justice Alito explained in the majority opinion:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]t is important to keep in mind that the purpose of this fiction is to provide protection for human beings. A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends. An established body of law specifies the rights and obligations of the people (including shareholders, officers, and employees) who are associated with a corporation in one way or another. When rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people. For example, extending Fourth Amendment protection to corporations protects the privacy interests of employees and others associated with the company. Protecting corporations from government seizure of their property without just compensation protects all those who have a stake in the corporations’ financial well-being. And protecting the free-exercise rights of corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control those companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The government’s argument in the case was two-fold.  First, business owners who chose to incorporate forfeited their 1st amendment protections under the RFRA and could no longer sue as individuals because incorporation made them legally separate from their businesses.  Second, because the corporation itself has no religion to exercise, it cannot sue on behalf of the owners.  Thus incorporation of a for-profit company implies that the free-exercise rights of the owners were forfeited. This would mean that owners would face a choice &#8212; either they could get the benefits of incorporation, or they could keep the protection granted by the RFRA.  As the majority noted, adopting this rule would have widespread consequences.  For example, it would mean that Orthodox Jewish store owners would be unable to sue claiming that mandatory Sunday closing laws violated their religious freedom.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the government was asking was for the Court to create a new legal distinction between individuals and non-profit corporations on the one hand and for-profit corporations on the other.  The court considered multiple possible arguments for creating such a distinction, but found none of them persuasive in light of existing precedent.  The distinction couldn’t be based on either the corporate form or the profit-making object because non-profit corporations and individuals operating as merchants are allowed to bring challenges. Nor could the issue be that for-profit corporations do not have a religious purpose because corporate law allows corporations to be formed for any lawful purpose.  And for-profit corporations can and do pursue a multitude of alternative goals.  In this particular case, all of the corporations involved had legally-binding policies requiring them to operate according to religious principles.  Furthermore, a distinction between non-profits and for-profits would encounter practical problems.  Many religious and charitable corporations are technically organized as for-profit corporations in order to be able to lobby and campaign for political candidates. And over half the states specifically allow for special dual-purpose corporations to accommodate such organizations.</p>
<p>Because they could not find a basis for making the distinction that the government wanted and because of the practical problems that such a distinction would create, the Court concluded that the RFRA protects the religious freedom of a corporation’s owners.  Consequently, these three corporations were entitled to an exemption on the same basis that a religious non-profit would be.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that many of the issues that are being discussed by people commenting on this case were <em>not</em> decided.  For example, the government did not contest the sincerity of the religious beliefs involved.  But more importantly, and contrary to widespread misreporting, whether a corporation was a person for purposes of the RFRA was <em>not at issue</em>.</p>
<p>Personhood wasn’t an issue because there is a special law called the Dictionary Act that defines a host of legal terms used in other statutes.  Because the RFRA protects &#8220;a person&#8221; but does not define the word &#8220;person&#8221;, the Dictionary Act&#8217;s definition of &#8220;person&#8221; is meant to apply.  And under that Act, &#8220;corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies&#8221; are included in the meaning of “person”.  Furthermore, the HRSA even conceded that the definition of &#8220;person&#8221; within the RFRA included non-profit corporations.  And because no known legal definition of &#8220;person&#8221; includes some corporations but not others, for-profit corporations would also be protected.  Therefore the case instead hinged on whether a for-profit corporation could be said to “exercise religion” <em>on behalf of its owners</em>.  As discussed above, the idea that a corporation is a legal person is long-established fiction used to protect the rights of the people affiliated with the corporation.  So, rather than being about some legally uncontroversial point, the case was about whether a person could exercise their religion <em>via</em> a corporation in the same way that they could exercise it via some other organization.</p>
<p>Hopefully this has shed some light on the case and will help foster constructive discussion about the issues involved.</p>

Most of us can be forgiven for knowing Marxist theory better than the liberal tradition &mdash; it&#8217;s hard not to drink Marxism in with our schooling and culture &mdash; but popular historical narrative really does suffer by the omission of the &quot;bourgeois historians&quot; whom Marx himself credits as the precursors of his class theory.</p>
<p>In the BBC TV series <i>A History of Britain</i>, Schama asks about the English Peasants&#8217; Revolt of 1381, &quot;Was this a class war, then?&quot; (A term, he explains parenthetically that &quot;we&#8217;re not supposed to use since the official burial of Marxism.&quot;) A pause, while the camera angle changes to closeup. &quot;Yes,&quot; he says plainly. &quot;It was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not surprisingly,&quot; writes Schama in the print version of <i>A History of Britain</i>, &quot;it was in the second half of the fourteenth century that the legends of Robin Hood &hellip; first became genuinely popular.&quot;</p>
<p>But as I write in <a href="http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/class-war-in-the-time-of-robin-hood">&quot;Class War in the Time of Robin Hood&quot;</a> in today&#8217;s <i>Freeman</i>, Schama is appealing to the wrong class theory if he wants to explain the mindset of the commoners marching on London in the 14th century.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m far from the first to offer a libertarian revision of Robin Hood&#8217;s politics, but where I focus on the ideology of his earliest historical audience, most other treatments focus on the particulars of the legend.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://left-liberty.net/?p=429">&#8220;Robin Hood Revisionism&#8221;</a> by Karl Hess, <i>Libertarian Forum</i>, 1969</li>

</ul>
<p>On the other hand, Ayn Rand seems to have been happy to leave Robin Hood to the socialists:</p>
<p>&quot;It is said,&quot; <a href="http://readingregistry.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/ragnar-danneskjold-on-robin-hood/">Rand has Ragnar Danneskj&ouml;ld concede in <i>Atlas Shrugged</i></a>, that Robin Hood &quot;fought against the looting rulers and returned the loot to those who had been robbed, but that is not the meaning of the legend which has survived.</p>
<p>What do you think: is Robin Hood worth claiming for our tradition?</p>

But does that mean that everything the FCC does makes television worse?</p>
<p>All laws and regulations have unforeseen consequences. That usually means unintended damage, but there&#8217;s no law of history that says every unplanned outcome is pernicious.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an advocate of a free society &mdash; one in which all arrangements are voluntary and there is the least coercive interference from governments or other thugs &mdash; history will present you with an unending series of conundrums. Whom do you side with in the Protestant Reformation, for example? The Catholic Church banned books and tortured scholars, and their official structure is one of hierarchy and authority. Easy enemy, right? Clear-cut bad guy. But the Church had kept the State in check for centuries &mdash; and vice versa, permitting seeds of freedom to root and flourish in the gaps between power centers. Whereas the Protestant states tended to be <i>more</i> authoritarian than the Catholic ones, with Luther and Calvin (not to mention the Anglicans) advocating orthodoxy through force. There&#8217;s a reason all those Northern princes embraced the Reformation: they wanted a cozier partnership of church and state.</p>
<p>This is certainly not the history I was taught in my Protestant private schools.</p>
<p>Similarly, most of us were schooled to side with the Union in the Civil War, to see Lincoln as a savior and the Confederacy as pure evil. But as much as the war may have resulted, however accidentally, in emancipating slaves, it also obliterated civil liberties, centralized power, strengthened central banking and fiat currencies and &mdash; to borrow from Jeffrey Rogers Hummel&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G1SRDUK/?tag=thelibestan-20">great book title</a> &mdash; enslaved free men.</p>
<p>&quot;Father Abraham,&quot; as the pietists called him after his assassination, was a tyrant whose primary goal was always what he actually achieved: central power over an involuntary union. Recasting this guy as an abolitionist hero is one of the many perverse legacies of America&#8217;s official history. But it&#8217;s a mistake to simply reverse the Establishment&#8217;s verdict and claim that the Confederacy was heroic. Plenty of Johnny Rebs were fighting a righteous battle against what they rightly deemed to be foreign invaders, but even if you ignore the little problem of the South&#8217;s &quot;peculiar institution,&quot; the Confederate government was no more liberal than its Northern rival. &quot;While the Civil War saw the triumph in the North of Republican neo-mercantilism,&#8221; writes Hummel, &#8220;it saw the emergence in the South of full-blown State socialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reading history without taking sides may fit some scholarly ideal (actually, it seems to be a journalistic ideal created by the Progressive Movement to masquerade their views as the only unbiased ones), but it is not a realistic option. We cannot do value-free history. If we try, we instead hide or repress our biases, which makes them a greater threat to intellectual integrity.</p>
<p>Neither can we say, &quot;a plague on both their houses,&quot; and retreat to the realm of pure theory, libertarian or otherwise. We have to live in the real world, and even if we are not activists or revolutionaries, the same intellectual integrity that must reject &quot;neutrality&quot; also requires that we occasionally explore the question of second-best or least-evil options.</p>
<p>I remember several years ago, when my very libertarian boss surprised me by speaking in favor of increased regulation of banking. His point was that the banks were not free-market institutions; they were government-created cartels enjoying a political privilege that protected them from the consequences of the market while they surreptitiously depleted our property and spoiled the price system that drives all progress in the material world. Ideally, he&#8217;d want the government out of banking altogether, but in the meantime having them do less damage was better than letting them do more.</p>
<p>It may seem anticlimactic to follow the Reformation, Civil War, and fractional-reserve banking with a little-known FCC rule about TV programming from almost half a century ago, but I&#8217;ve been reading television history for a while now (<a href="http://bkmarcus.com/2013/09/16/right-wing-tv/">1</a>, <a href="http://bkmarcus.com/2013/09/23/should-we-thank-the-gop-for-quality-tv/">2</a>, <a href="http://bkmarcus.com/2013/09/30/are-advertisers-to-blame-for-bad-tv/">3</a>, <a href="http://bkmarcus.com/2013/10/09/the-freeman-tvs-third-golden-age/">4</a>) as illustrative of larger patterns in political history.</p>
<p>The Prime Time Access Rule (PTAR) was a law instituted in 1970 to limit the amount of network programming allowed during TV&#8217;s most-watched evening hours.</p>
<p>According to<i></i> industry analyst Les Brown, the PTAR was adopted</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to break the network monopoly over prime time, to open a new market for independent producers who complained of being at the mercy of three customers, to stimulate the creation of new program forms, and to give the stations the opportunity to do their most significant local programming in the choicest viewing hours. (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=07EYAAAAIAAJ"><i>Les Brown&#8217;s Encyclopedia of Television</i></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you still accept the official myth that the airwaves are &quot;That most public of possessions given into the trust of the networks,&quot; as Harlan Ellison describes them in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Teat">The Glass Teat</a>,</i> and that the federal government&#8217;s job is to manage the radio spectrum in the best interests of that public, then I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t see any problem with PTAR. (You can read my paper &quot;Radio Free Rothbard&quot; [<a href="http://invisibleorder.com/2012/04/18/radio-free-rothbard/">HTML</a>, <a href="http://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_2.pdf">PDF</a>] for a debunking of this official piety.)</p>
<p>But a libertarian could easily jerk his or her knee in the opposite direction. How dare the central government tell private station owners what they can and can&#8217;t air on their own stations, right?</p>
<p>The problem with such an ahistorical take on the issue is that broadcast television was a creature of the state from the beginning. Radio may have had a nascent free-market stage in its development, but television was a state-managed cartel from the word go.</p>
<p>So am I saying that PTAR was a good thing? Is it like the possibly beneficial banking regulations imposed on a cartelized banking system? Should we view CBS versus FCC as the same sort of balance-of-power game that Church and State played before the early modern period of European history?</p>
<p>Maybe, but that&#8217;s not why I find PTAR an interesting case for the liberty-minded historian. As is so often the case with laws and regulations, PTAR&#8217;s main legacy is in its unintended consequences.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the best of intentions,&quot; writes historian Gary Edgerton in <i>The Columbia History of American Television</i>, &quot;the PTAR failed in almost every respect when it was implemented in the fall of 1971.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]ractically no local productions or any programming innovations whatsoever were inspired by the PTAR. In addition, any increase in independently produced programming was mainly restricted to the reworking of previously canceled network series, such as Edward Gaylord&#8217;s <i>Hee Haw</i> and Lawrence Welk&#8217;s <i>The Lawrence Welk Show</i>.&hellip; Rather than locally produced programming, these kinds of first-run syndicated shows dominated the 7 to 8 P.M. time slot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This renaissance of recently purged rural programming was certainly not the FCC&#8217;s goal, but the creation of the first-run-syndication model is one of the great unsung events in media history.</p>
<p>A quick note on terminology: to the extent that I knew the word &quot;syndication&quot; at all when I was growing up, I took it to be a fancy way of saying &quot;reruns.&quot; For example, Paramount, the studio that bought the rights to <i>Star Trek</i> after the series was cancelled, sold the right to rerun the program directly to individual TV stations. When a local TV station buys a program directly from the studio instead of through the network system, that&#8217;s called syndication. But syndication isn&#8217;t limited to reruns. Studios created first-run TV programs for direct sale to local stations as far back as the 1950s, but they were the exception. The dominant syndication model was and is reruns. But two events created a surge of first-run syndication: (1) PTAR, and (2) the rural purge I obliquely alluded to above.</p>
<p>I write about the rural purge <a href="http://bkmarcus.com/2013/10/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-rural-comedy-take-1/">here</a>, but I&#8217;ll summarize: as the 1960s turned into the 1970s, television network executives did an about-face on their entire approach to programming. In the 1960s, each network tried to win the largest possible viewership by avoiding controversy and appealing to the lowest common denominator in public tastes. This meant ignoring the rift between races, between generations, and between urban and rural sensibilities &mdash; what we now call red-state and blue-state values &mdash; in the ongoing culture wars. This approach was dubbed LOP (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_objectionable_program">Least Objectionable Program</a>) theory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, this theory posits that viewers watch TV no matter what, usually choosing the least objectionable show available to them. Furthermore, it assumes a limited number of programming choices for audiences to pick from and implies that networks, advertising agencies, and sponsors care little about quality when producing and distributing shows. (Gary Edgerton, <i>The Columbia History of American Television</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the end of the decade, however, NBC vice president Paul Klein (who had christened LOP theory just as its tenure was coming to an end), convinced advertisers that they should stop caring so much about total viewership and focus instead on demographics, specifically the Baby Boomers &mdash; young, politically radicalized, and increasingly urban TV viewers &mdash; who were most likely to spend the most money on the most products. CBS was winning the battle for ratings, but Klein pointed out that their audience was made up of old folks and hicks, whereas NBC was capturing the viewership of the up-and-comers.</p>
<p>Klein may have worked for NBC, but it was CBS who took his message to heart, quite dramatically. In 1970, the network rocked the TV world by cancelling its most reliably popular shows: <i>Petticoat Junction</i>, <i>Green Acres</i>, <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i>, <i>Mayberry RFD</i>, <i>Hee Haw</i>, <i>Lassie</i>, and <i>The Lawrence Welk Show</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0815605048/?tag=thelibestan-20"><i>Television&#8217;s Second Gold Age</i></a>, communications professor Robert J. Thompson writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CBS, in an effort to appeal to a younger audience made socially conscious by the turbulent 1960s, had dumped its hit rural comedies in the first years of the 1970s while their aging audiences were still placing them in Nielsen&#8217;s top twenty-five. Critics, who for the most part had loathed the likes of <i>Petticoat Junction</i> and <i>Gomer Pyle</i>, loved some of what replaced them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I loved what replaced them, too: <i>Mary Tyler Moore</i>, <i>All in the Family</i>, <i>M*A*S*H</i>, and the like. &quot;Several members of Congress,&quot; Wikipedia informs us, &quot;expressed displeasure at some of the replacement shows, many of which &hellip; were not particularly family-friendly.&quot; But that was the point: the networks were no longer aiming to please the whole family: just the most reliable consumers.</p>
<p>But despite capitalism&#8217;s cartoonish reputation for catering only to the bloated hump of the bell curve, that&#8217;s not how the market really works. It <i>is</i> how a cartel works, and the broadcast networks behaved accordingly, both before and after the rural purge. In the 1950s and &#8217;60s, they aimed for the largest possible viewership and to hell with minorities of any sort. The demographic revolution changed the target, but not the tactic: aim for the big soft mass. That&#8217;s certainly how the big players would behave in a free market, too, but the telltale sign of freedom in the economy is that the big players aren&#8217;t the only players. Fortunes are made in niche markets, too, so long as there aren&#8217;t barriers to entering those niches. As I&#8217;ve said, TV is descended from radio, and Hoover and his corporatist cronies had arranged it so that there could only be a few big players.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where we come back to the FCC&#8217;s Prime Time Access Rule of 1970. PTAR created a hole at the fringe of the prime-time schedule, just as the rural purge was creating a hole in the market. All those fans of <i>Hee Haw</i> and <i>Lawrence Welk</i> didn&#8217;t just go away, and they didn&#8217;t stop spending their money on advertised products, either. Before PTAR, the multitude of fans of &quot;rural&quot; programming would have had to settle for mid-afternoon reruns of their favorite shows (the way <i>Star Trek</i> fans haunted its late-night reruns around this same time). But the rural fans didn&#8217;t have to settle for reruns, and they didn&#8217;t have to settle for mid afternoons or late nights. They could watch new episodes of <i>Hee Haw</i> or <i>Lawrence Welk</i> at 7 PM. In fact, those two shows continued to produce new episodes and the local stations, which were no longer <i>allowed</i> to buy from the networks for the early evening hours, bought first-run syndicated shows instead. <i>The Lawrence Welk Show</i>, which had started in the early 1950s, continued for another decade, until Welk retired in the early &#8217;80s. And the repeats continue to run on PBS today. <i>Hee Haw</i>, believe it or not, continued to produce original shows for syndication until 1992.</p>
<p>I loved Mary Tyler Moore, and I didn&#8217;t care so much for Lawrence Welk, but what I really love is peaceful diversity, which cannot exist in a winner-takes-all competition. The rise of first-run syndication was a profound crack in the winner-takes-all edifice of network programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The strategy CBS, NBC, and ABC had gravitated toward for short-term success &mdash; namely, targeting specific demographics with their programming &mdash; also sowed the seeds of change where the TV industry as a whole would eventually move well beyond its mass market model. Over the next decade, a whole host of technological, industrial, and programming innovations would usher in an era predicated on an entirely new niche-market philosophy that essentially turned the vast majority of broadcasters into narrowcasters. (Gary Edgerton, <i>The Columbia History of American Television</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea of &quot;narrowcasting&quot; is the basis of quality in entertainment (and freedom in political economy, but that&#8217;s another story).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not out to sing the praises of the FCC for increasing economic competition and cultural diversity &mdash; these consequences were entirely unintended &mdash; but we do have to recognize PTAR as a pebble in Goliath&#8217;s sandle, distracting him for a moment from David&#8217;s sling.</p>

I&#8217;ve been a pretty steady Rothbardian-Hoppean-Austrian anarcho-libertarian since then, for about 25 years. I try to develop my views carefully, systematically, precisely, and incrementally, building on, referencing, and integrating with previous things I&#8217;ve figured out. Sort of like the Kinsellian/libertarian common law.</p>
<p>On occasion I realize I made a mistake and try to regroup or redress it. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a matter of emphasis, like my de-emphasis in recent years of American constitutionalism (see <a style="color: #111111;" title="Permanent link to Down with the Fourth of July" href="http://www.stephankinsella.com/2011/07/down-with-the-fourth-of-july/" rel="bookmark">Down with the Fourth of July</a> and <a style="color: #111111;" title="Permanent link to On Constitutional Sentimentalism" href="http://www.stephankinsella.com/2011/01/on-constitutional-sentimentalism/" rel="bookmark">On Constitutional Sentimentalism</a>)  and certain changes in emphasis in terminology (I now prefer  the term state to &#8220;government,&#8221; aggression to &#8220;coercion,&#8221; and refer to the object of ownership or property rights as a scarce resource rather than as &#8220;property,&#8221; primarily to avoid the equivocation that statists invariably engage in). I also think I slightly misstepped in my previous criticism of Rothbard on inalienability (see <a style="color: #2361a1;" href="http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_4.pdf">Inalienability and Punishment: A Reply to George Smith</a>), though I stand by my criticism of Rothbard&#8217;s IP views and his debtor&#8217;s prison comments (I plan to elaborate on this soon). I&#8217;m also a little bit more gun-shy about engaging in <a href="http://archive.mises.org/5391/the-limits-of-armchair-theorizing-the-case-of-threats/">armchair theorizing</a> now than I was as a young pup.<span id="more-13475"></span></p>
<p>One area in which I misstepped was in my 1995 <em>JLS</em> article “<a style="color: #2361a1;" href="http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/11_2/11_2_5.pdf">Legislation and the Discovery of Law in a Free Society</a>,” <em>Journal of Libertarian Studies</em> 11 (Summer 1995), a summary version of which appears here: “<a style="color: #2361a1;" href="http://mises.org/daily/4147">Legislation and Law in a Free Society</a>,” <em>Mises Daily</em> (Feb. 25, 2010). I stand by most of this article but in one part, I relied too much on the Hayekian &#8220;knowledge problem&#8221; interpretation of the economic calculation problem, and Leoni&#8217;s application of this to legislation. Since that article I became more skeptical of the entire Hayekian &#8220;knowledge&#8221; paradigm (see <a style="color: #2361a1;" href="http://archive.mises.org/005306/">Knowledge vs. Calculation</a>, Mises Blog (July 11, 2006)), as I noted in subsequent articles, such as my 1999 <em>QJAE</em> review essay, <a style="color: #2361a1;" href="http://www.mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/Qjae2_4_4.pdf">Knowledge, Calculation, Conflict, and Law </a>(see footnote 5, e.g). Oh, that I had heeded <a style="color: #2361a1;" href="http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/herbener-comments-kinsella-legislation.pdf">Jeff Herbener’s comments</a> on an earlier manuscript, but I either got these comments too late, or did not fully appreciate them at the time. But now I am skeptical of the idea that the problem with legislation is some kind of knowledge problem that also plagues central economic planning. I too uncritically adopted Leoni&#8217;s Hayekian-type analysis in <em>Freedom and the Law</em>, and repeated it in section III.C.2 of my paper. I am also skeptical now of the over-used term &#8220;spontaneous&#8221; that Hayekians sprinkle throughout their writing; I find it usually adds nothing to the analysis (try removing the word &#8220;spontaneous&#8221; or &#8220;spontaneously&#8221; from a sentence when you hear a Hayekian use it, and see if the meaning changes). There are lots of problem with legislation, which I point out in the article  (see also <a style="color: #2361a1;" href="http://archive.mises.org/10838/another-problem-with-legislation-james-carter-v-the-field-codes/">Another Problem with Legislation: James Carter v. the Field Codes</a>), but this knowledge analysis is in my view problematic.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this when I was listening to the Cato podcast below, with comments on Bruno Leoni&#8217;s thought, in particular those of Pete Boettke, in which he reiterates the Hayek/Leoni &#8220;the problem with legislation is a knowledge problem view&#8221; approach that I adopted in the 1995 article, and which I largely reject now.</p>

People quickly accuse each other of supporting Putin’s aggression or backing violent U.S. intervention. I myself have been accused of both kissing up to the Russian regime and dishing out State Department propaganda. This doesn’t itself show I have the right balance in my position, only that this feud has galvanized libertarians and hardened their rhetorical loyalties.</p>
<p>We might learn something from looking back at the 20<sup>th</sup> century. During the Cold War, most western critics of state power erred too far in one direction or the other. There were some whose opposition to U.S. wars led them to soften their assessment of communist aggression. Free-market and leftist lovers of peace both made this mistake. At the same time, many who favored economic and political liberty often let their anti-communism translate into support for American militarism and the security state. This confusion pervaded Americans across the spectrum.</p>
<p>We can all see this now: Yes, some antiwar Americans were obscenely soft on the communists. Well-meaning but foolish westerners said nice things about Lenin, Stalin, and Mao—and many of a more moderate tinge had no perspective of just how much worse international communism was than the U.S. system, at least as it concerned domestic affairs. Meanwhile, many libertarians and almost all conservatives ditched their supposed attachment to skepticism of government power and signed onto the U.S. Cold War effort. This American project included dozens of coups and interventions, the instruction of foreign secret police in unspeakable torture techniques, murderous carpet bombings that killed hundreds of thousands of peasants, and wars that indirectly brought about the Khmer Rouge and the rise of Islamist fundamentalism, both of which also became directly funded in the name of anti-communism.</p>
<p>It is easy to look back and see how westerners were wrong on both the Cold War and communist states—each of which killed millions of people and nearly brought the world to the brink of nuclear holocaust.</p>
<p><span id="more-13428"></span></p>
<p>The stakes were so much higher then than in anything going on with Russia now. Imprecision in one’s moral assessment—either in defense of Nixon or Tito—was far more condemnable than criticizing Putin or Obama too harshly. The errors of almost all the great 20<sup>th</sup> century libertarians, free marketers, and peaceniks far exceeded any errors some might have today in their appraisal of NATO or Russia and Ukraine. And yet we forgive many people on both sides of that Cold War division. No one today actually thinks Hayek was a neocon or Rothbard a pinko.</p>
<p>Today’s polarization is all the more frustrating given that the bulk of American libertarians seem to agree on two major points: (1) the U.S. should not intervene in Eastern Europe and (2) Putin’s various power grabs are indefensible. Thus, most libertarians are not truly as divided as well-meaning Americans were in the Cold War.</p>
<p>Now, one’s emphasis is important. Not all acts of aggression are equal. But before addressing that, it’s useful to try to actually understand the splits in the movement right now.</p>
<p>I easily identify four factions, not two: (A) There are people who outright defend Putin’s aggression in Ukraine and Crimea, and who otherwise downplay his autocratic tendencies; (B) There are those who agree that Putin is worth condemning, but who think it’s more important to emphasize the evils of U.S. interventionism; (C) There are those who agree that U.S. intervention is unwise and maybe even unethical, but who think it’s most important right now to emphasize Putin’s despotism; (D) There are those who outright favor U.S. and western intervention to stop Putin.</p>
<p>The polarization of discussion has led to A and B teaming up against C and D. It has also led to people in the B camp pretending like “no one” on their side is actually defending Putin, while people in the C camp are pretending “no one” on their side is actually calling for war or major U.S. interventions.</p>
<p>A principled opponent of state power is tempted to say that in fact B and C are on one side, despite differences in emphasis, and A and D are two extremes flirting with nationalist statism. This is my position, although I will say that I have friends—good friends—who flirt with being in camp A as well as in camp D. It happens. And to make the point again, during the Cold War, any libertarian activist would have probably had some friends who advocated nuclear strikes against the USSR, and others who supported Soviet control of the Eastern Bloc. Both of these positions would have been completely immoral and disgusting—far worse than anything said by anyone in Camp A or Camp D today. Yet today’s Cold War replay is leading people to defriend each other in the name of Manichean struggle. The tendency of people to break ties with others over this will only increase the polarization and erode mutual understanding.</p>
<p>On the other hand, camps A and D are at least being outright in their positions, while B and C are letting themselves get dragged into a flame war against each other when they both agree on both Putin’s and America’s actions. Both B and C are being disingenuous about some of their allies in the attempt to seem reasonable and principled and to say the other side is the only one that’s unbalanced.</p>
<p>In both cases, the problem appears to be nationalism—a desire to defend Putin’s actions as consistent with Russian, rather than individualist, concerns; or a desire to see American intervention as being more defensible than Russian aggression because, well, at least it’s American, and we have better, more liberal values at home. Both tendencies are in fact very illiberal, as are the attempts to collectively attack people on the “other side” of this debate when for all you know some of them agree with you on all the fundamentals more than some of the people “on your side” do.</p>
<p>The arguments over Russia have brought the Cold War back to the movement. They have fractured those primarily committed to anti-interventionism and those primarily concerned with liberty for all worldwide, when in fact these values are two sides of the same coin. The primary libertarian reason to oppose U.S. wars, of course, is that they kill foreigners, that they divide people into tribes based on nationality, that they are acts of nationalist aggression.</p>
<p>Discursively, refighting the Cold War within libertarianism will only harden people’s hearts, polarize their loyalties, and ultimately compromise their principles and clarity of thought. I plead young libertarians to refuse to be a proxy belligerent in this Cold War when for the most part it’s probably not really about Russia or Crimea at all; it’s about major factions within the movement with more fundamental disagreements using this as an opportunity to fight. If you actually seek to understand everyone’s positions, you’ll be surprised how heterogeneous attitudes are, despite the attempt to turn this current affairs disagreement into a grander sectarian dispute.</p>
<p>So what should we think? We should probably take a middle ground between B and C. Putin isn’t just an aggressor; he’s one of the worst on the planet. He killed tens of thousands of Chechens. He oversees one of the most vast prison populations on earth. He is essentially a late-communist holdover of the party variety in everything but name, and his violations of civil liberties, free speech, and the dignity of homosexuals and others are not minor matters for any libertarian who cares about the rights of all people on earth. His invasion of Ukraine was unjustified. His annexation of Crimea cannot be defended and although some critics have exaggerated the evils of this territorial power grabs by comparing them to Stalin’s or Hitler’s expansionism, it is true that Putin’s defenders’ arguments based on ethnic nationalism could indeed be used to justify the most infamous European land grabs that occurred that same decade.</p>
<p>As for the United States, its foreign policy is a lot worse than Putin’s biggest detractors wish to acknowledge. While Putin has killed more people than Obama, he does not appear to have killed more people as Bush—and yes, it is a moral failure and deviation from libertarianism to downplay the Iraq war as anything less than one of the very worst international atrocities of our new century, and one that dramatically taints the moral character of U.S. diplomacy. What the last few U.S. administrations have done will haunt much of the world for decades. And the aggression has hardly ceased. Obama’s drone killings are one of the most infamous human rights violations on the planet, the drug war imposed on Mexico has taken tens of thousands of lives, and America’s own civil liberties record is far worse than some on Team America wish to confront. There are tens of millions of people much worse off throughout the world because of recent U.S. diplomacy and wars, and only a cold utilitarian would even attempt to justify this record.</p>
<p>I understand why some libertarians are inclined to emphasize one point or the other. Those Americans focusing on U.S. criminality are right that we have more influence, albeit marginally so, on the government that lords over us, that if we don’t stand up to the U.S. war machine and its covert ops, no one will, and that criticism of foreign aggression often fuels war propaganda at home. But others are frustrated that just because the U.S. government condemns Russian aggression, they’re supposed to keep quiet. “My country is the world,” as Tom Paine said, and libertarians around the world should condemn aggression anywhere it happens. Pretending the U.S. government is the world’s only major problem is naïve at best. The first group is often right that liberal states are more belligerent in foreign affairs, and the second group is often right that it’s easy for people here to forget about victims of foreign oppression. Such dynamics played themselves out in the Cold War, too, and both sides had a point. It would have been demoralizing to be berated for attacking either U.S. or Soviet aggression in those times.</p>
<p>It is hard to maintain the right level of nuance and principle. I think <a href="http://antiwar.com/blog/2014/03/26/where-a-libertarian-should-stand-on-crimea/">John Glaser</a> and the <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/03/06/4-concepts-about-the-ukraine-crisis-that">Jesse Walker blog entry</a> he links to are good models of principled libertarian commentary. And I agree with plenty of points being made on multiple sides of the various controversies. Those who wish to purge either Ron Paul’s followers or the Student for Liberty internationalists over this are ignoring the points of agreement as well as the odious errors on their own side, and maybe even their own errors, and are blowing things out of proportion.</p>
<p>Did I myself get the balance perfectly right? Perhaps not. The right balance would have been even harder during the Cold War, and yet it would have mattered much more then. So please, everyone, take a step back. It’s fun as hell to get in faction fights. Sectarian squabbles are the force that gives us meaning. But you’ll find yourself drained and with fewer friends in the end. Don’t pretend your fellow libertarians are themselves worse than Russian nationalists or the Pentagon. It’s not true in either case. Our unifying enemy should be the same: aggression, whether it is ordered from Moscow or Washington DC.</p>
<p>Whenever anyone strays from this balance, it’s good to bring up what they’re missing. Then you’ll see who your true allies are, who the trolls are, and who is simply using this as a battle to refight old clashes in the movement. You’ll also find out what people’s actual position is, and that might help inform your own.</p>

<p>Julie Eva Borowski has done it again with a solid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXPOLpVUjo4">video on the issue of libertarian in-flighting</a>. The caricature has me saying something wonderful about the decision to pour milk in my cereal. &#8220;Beautiful anarchy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not entirely absurd. The decision to pour milk or not to pour milk is an illustration of human volition that is embodied in all our decisions. There is no police present at the moment of choice. There is no plan in place that makes us pour or not to pour. Even if there were a plan, it is likely to be ignored. It would be destined to fail.</p>
<p>Actually, as I think about it, there is something of a plan. According to the government, cereal is only part of a &#8220;nutritious breakfast.&#8221; You know, the pictures on the ads. There is a big glass of orange juice, a piece of toast with butter, probably another glass of milk, and probably a half slice of grapefruit. It&#8217;s absurd. I&#8217;ve never seen anyone eat all that on a regular basis with cereal. On the contrary, we shake the box in the bowl and eat. We are defying the plan, even that urged on us by manufacturers.</p>
<p>So yes, there is a core of anarchism in the decision to pour and eat.</p>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t just stop with the pouring and eating. The anarchist dimension of production is illustrated in the very existence of milk and cereal.</p>
<p><span id="more-13407"></span></p>
<p>Humankind lived 6,000 without a reliable source for milk. Milk spoils. It must be transported before that happens. Before trains and refrigeration, you were pretty much out of luck, unless you owned a goat or cow, or someone close by did. We underestimate what a seminal moment it was in the history of civilization for milk to be delivered to your doorstep back in the 1930s and 1940s. It was wonderful practice and culturally significant commercial institution, displaced only with the mass spread of electric refrigeration in the 1950s. If you think about it, we are only a few generations into a period in which people could reliably keep things cold in all months of the year. Milk was and is a luxury good.</p>
<p>There was no plan. There was no government push. It happened because of private enterprise operating in the spirit of freedom: &#8220;people need stuff so let&#8217;s get it to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now to the source of milk itself. It comes from cows. Modern socialists hate cows because they seem implausibly inefficient. They eat vast amounts of grain and grass, take up huge swaths of land that could be used for farming, and otherwise consume an enormous amount of resources. To keep one alive just to milk is a big expense, one requiring the accumulation of capital and long-term planning.</p>
<p>Think of this: no central planner, a person who assumes that he or she knows better than the market, would ever approve of a cow. On the face of it, there would be no way to know for sure, in absence of market prices and a profit-and-loss system, that a cow should be allowed to live.</p>
<p>Now to the cereal question. The variety and brands have delighted generations. No one person can make a box of cereal. It takes thousands, with ingredients that can come from all over the world. But there is an additional point here worth considering. Many brands have been around for decades and generations. They persist and persist. It is point of unity between us: we&#8217;ve all had Cheerios, Shredded Wheat, Sugar/Honey Smacks, Cap&#8217;n Crunch.</p>
<p>I was in the car the other day with some people I had not met and we were all fishing around for topics. Finally I brought up cereal, and the whole scene came to life. We talked and talked about the changes in Crunchberries, the shifts over the years in Lucky Charms, the yuckiness of puffed wheat, and much more. It was pure delight.</p>
<p>So within the cereal industry, we have authentic tradition at work. That&#8217;s an interesting observation about a market institution. Markets are said to be in constant upheaval and thereby always in a war against tradition. This is not actually the case. Cereal is a persistent tradition, even down to the original brand names. It has been done without any plans from government, any preservation boards and bureaus, or even hectoring traditionalists warning us against abandoning the permanent things.</p>
<p>We can therefore see how anarchism isn&#8217;t really about unrelenting unpredictability. Within cereal markets, we can see that anarchist-like production can preserve valuable traditions insofar as consumers &#8212; the real power behind the market &#8212; want it to be this way.</p>
<p>What the milk and cereal market needs is more anarchism, not less. Raw milk should be completely legal here as most everywhere else in the world. People should be allowed more choice. It is the same with the regulations and taxes that make entry into the cereal market more expensive than it ought to be. Let there be more brands, more producers, ever more choice.</p>
<p>And yet, let&#8217;s return to Julie&#8217;s original example of the decision to pour milk. In the end, it is ours and ours alone. There is no force of the state that can successfully enforce a single choice in this area. States aren&#8217;t that powerful and they never will be.</p>
<p>So, yes, let us eat cereal, pour milk, and consider the great lessons of this event. It really does illustrate a beautiful anarchy.</p>

<p>“Best article I’ve read in decades.”</p>
<p>That’s the message I received from so many people when my article “<a href="http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/against-libertarian-brutalism">Against Libertarian Brutalism</a>” first appeared.</p>
<p>A day later, I started to receive a different message.</p>
<p>“This article is evil and you are evil for having written it.”</p>
<p>Actually, the critics didn’t quite say that in those words. Mostly the language of the article’s detractors is unprintable. If I had any doubts that my piece was necessary, the reactions, some of them give new meaning to the phrase “violent prose,” removed them all. In fact, many people said that they had no idea that brutalism was a big problem until they saw the egregious responses to my piece. Thus did the persistent and non-relevant question regarding against whom this article was written answer itself.</p>
<p>There was another reaction that I found amusing. It came down to: heck yeah brutalism! This reaction mostly stems from the coolness factor of the word. I can only assume that the people who said this didn’t really read the piece and hadn’t entirely understood just how precise, authentic, distorted, and fundamentally awful the brutalist worldview really is.</p>
<p>In general, I find the debate and frenzy to be great. A writer aspires to write a piece that achieves that.</p>
<p>Still, I’m still not entirely sure why the article excited such controversy. What worried me at first is that I had actually underestimated the influence of the brutalist perspective. But as I think about it, and look carefully at the opposition, it really does come down to about half a dozen people. They felt accused, from which I can only conclude that my description of the brutalist mind was more evocative than I knew.</p>
<p><span id="more-13386"></span></p>
<p>This article began as a private study, a memo to myself, a reminder of why we are in the liberty business. We’ve all felt that need to tell the hard truth. Assert the raw and unadorned core repeatedly and dogmatically. React with righteous anger and fury, even without elaboration, to the point of being downright offensive. There is a role for this. Injustice in our midst &#8212; and there is so much of it &#8212; cries out for it.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call this brutalist. I would call this righteous passion, and it is what we should feel when we look at ugly and immoral things like war, the prison state, mass surveillance, routine violations of people’s rights. The question is whether this style of argument defines us or whether we can go beyond it, not only to lash out in reaction &#8212; to dwell only in raw oppositional emotion &#8212; but also to see a broad and positive alternative.</p>
<p>What is the right balance? How can we cling to and rally around fundamental rights, even when the conclusions are discomforting, and, at the same time, maintain a broadness of mind to see the larger goal and dream of liberty itself?</p>
<p>I came to be intrigued at the analogy between a deeply distorted, but still interesting, school of architecture and certain trends and intellectual tendencies you see in the libertarian world.</p>
<p>It fascinates me because there are often parallels between the world of art and the world of political ideology. This was better understood in 19th century European politics, when political parties tended to rally around certain composers: in Germany, for example, whether you preferred Brahms to Wagner told you something about a person’s view of German territorial disputes.</p>
<p>In the case of brutalist architecture, a school of thought that lived for 20 years after 1950, we had an edgy ideology at work, one based on a truth gone mad. That truth is that a building serves a function. It exists mainly to serve that function. The brutalists believed that everything beyond that function is a distraction, an invasion, a corruption. A building should not be art. It is not marketing, it is not for human delight. It must only tell one truth and never elaborate on that one truth. Of course this view represents not only an attack on modernity but all of history. It is affected in the extreme. Even the caves had art.</p>
<p>That brutalist tendency can exist within politics too. You see it in every election season. Forget all subtlety, all reservation, all mental questioning: just vote for X because that will cause all wrongs to be righted. In this way politics is brutalist.</p>
<p>But as I read about brutalism, I couldn’t help but wonder if this tendency is alive in the libertarian world I know so well. This is why Ludwig von Mises addressed this problem at length in his 1927 book Liberalism. He was emphatic that the foundation of liberalism is private property. But he doesn’t stop there. With that comes peace, tolerance, prosperity, and the flourishing of the common good. These are foundational ideals. He says that liberalism is the only ideology that can consistently and correctly state that it is not a party, a faction, a special interest, a narrow concern, or a private bias. It genuinely believes in the whole: liberalism speaks to the destiny of humankind..</p>
<p>This is the spirit I sought to evoke in this piece. I recall when I first read this book, how it inspired me. Yes, it sought to defend the rights of people to do nonviolent but still ghastly things. That’s important. More than that, however, this book conjured up for me a vision of global order ruled by no one but participated in by everyone. The book has haunted me in so many ways. It was the last statement of the old liberal worldview, a glimpse of a vision that once was but could be again. It’s big, high minded, beautiful.</p>
<p>What if the theme of liberty becomes the slogan of sectors of life that are fundamentally anti-social? That is part of the price of liberty itself. Liberty can deal with it. But what if we take it one step further and the intellectuals who defend liberty become exclusively celebratory of such elements? What if the racists, sexists, and anti-semites become heroes in their minds because, for whatever is wrong with their view of the world, they are defying what they see as the prevailing regime? What if libertarianism becomes the great gloss to cover up the hidden desire to achieve personal power, malevolent longings, antisocial urges, and authoritarian ends? I view this as a distortion and a problem, one against which we need to steel ourselves.</p>
<p>The most persistent response to my piece was the demand to know about whom in particular the article was written. Of course my piece did not name names because no one fully embodies brutalism. The real point was to draw attention to a tendency or archetype that keeps rearing its head. It has done so in my own writings variously through the years &#8212; as if I had woken up on the wrong side of the bed. None of us is immune. This is the whole point of demons and ideals: not to describe perfect exemplars but to urge everyone to avoid the pitfalls and long for the best that is in our hearts.</p>
<p>We all need reminders of why we are in the business of studying and promoting the ideas of liberty. It is not really about hating the state, even if that is something we must do. It is not really about celebrating the rights of malevolent forces in our midst, even though they deserve a defense. Hate is not the theme. (When Murray Rothbard used to say that “hate is my muse,” he was being facetious; that man loved liberty like life itself.)</p>
<p>The reason to believe in liberty is actually benevolent, humble, and rooted in love: we believe in the possibilities of humanity. No state &#8212; forever freezing the world in place, presuming to know the unknowable, brutally suppressing dissent, regimenting behavior and ideas, robbing and murdering to realize its goals at the expense of society &#8212; can unleash the creative and service-oriented possibilities of the human mind. On the contrary, states, like all expression of power in society, cut off and destroy what society tries to create and self-correct.</p>
<p>The brutalist mind samples that of the state. It believes in its infallibility, separates the world into those who comply and those who do not, admits no error, sees no coloration, opposes all elaboration and emendation, rules through intimidation, tolerates no diversity, recoils from intellectual struggle, stamps out all uncertainty, opposes innovation, never admits error. You see this in the buildings that brutalist styling produced, and you see this in the ideological world too. You feel it when you wince at what they produce.</p>
<p>We need liberty for civilization to emerge, to be sustained, to improve. There is absolutely nothing brutalist about that goal. On the contrary, the longing for liberty is rooted in our most wonderful dreams for ourselves and everyone.</p>
