<p>Contrary to Bill Duncan&rsquo;s claims in his recent op-ed (&ldquo;Voucher law has no real help for low-income kids,&rdquo; Sept. 19-Oct. 2 NHBR), last month&rsquo;s unanimous New Hampshire Supreme Court decision to reject his lawsuit against New Hampshire&rsquo;s educational choice law is a victory for Granite State families and taxpayers generally.</p>
<p>The law expands educational opportunity by granting tax credits to corporations worth 85 percent of their donations to nonprofit scholarship organizations. These nonprofits, like the Network for Educational Opportunity, help low- and middle-income parents pay tuition at a private school or an out-of-district public school, or cover certain homeschooling expenses.</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan contended that the law violates the New Hampshire constitution&rsquo;s historically anti-Catholic &ldquo;Blaine Amendment,&rdquo; which bars the government from allocating public money to religious schools. A trial court judge partially agreed, upholding the law but limiting the scholarships to secular schools.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">The state Supreme Court&#8217;s recent decision clears the way for expanding educational options for New Hampshire families.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In August, the Supreme Court overturned the lower court&rsquo;s ruling and threw out the challenge entirely, holding that Mr. Duncan and his petitioners had no standing because they failed to show &ldquo;that some right of theirs has been prejudiced or impaired as a result of the program&rsquo;s implementation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the standing of petitioners challenging a similar scholarship tax credit law in Arizona. The court ruled that tax credits, like tax deductions and tax exemptions, are not &ldquo;public money&rdquo; because the funds do not &ldquo;come into the tax collector&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No reasonable person believes that a church is &ldquo;publicly funded&rdquo; because donors who support it receive a charitable tax deduction, or even because the church receives a 100 percent property tax exemption. Likewise, the aid that families receive from scholarship organizations is not &ldquo;public money&rdquo; just because corporate donors received a partial tax credit.</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan stated that the choice law has &ldquo;no legitimate public purpose.&rdquo; Apparently he does not believe that expanding educational opportunity for low-income families, increasing parental satisfaction and improving student outcomes serves a &ldquo;public purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a survey of scholarship recipients last year, nearly 97 percent of families reported being satisfied with their chosen learning environment, including 90 percent who were &ldquo;very satisfied.&rdquo; Far from being &ldquo;unaccountable,&rdquo; as Mr. Duncan absurdly claimed, private schools are held directly accountable to parents, who can leave if they are not satisfied.</p>
<p>Moreover, more than two-thirds of parents reported seeing &ldquo;measurable improvement in academic achievement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>High-quality research demonstrates that expanding access to educational options improves student outcomes. Eleven of 12 random-assignment studies found that choice programs benefited all or some categories of students, especially those who were the least advantaged.</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan also falsely claimed that the law could cost the state up to $5.1 million next year. While that&rsquo;s the maximum amount of tax credits available, surely someone who serves on the New Hampshire Board of Education, as Mr. Duncan does, would realize that the law also reduces expenditures.</p>
<p>A 2012 fiscal impact analysis by the Josiah Bartlett Center (my former employer) found that, if fully utilized, the scholarship program would save $8 million over the course of two state budgets. That&rsquo;s because the law caps scholarships at $2,500 on average, which is considerably less than the state&rsquo;s contribution to local public schools of roughly $4,000 per pupil, and only a small fraction of the average $15,600 per pupil spent by public schools statewide.</p>
<p>Sadly, Mr. Duncan&rsquo;s misguided legal challenge prevented taxpayers from realizing those savings and, worse, prevented many families from receiving scholarships. Mr. Duncan scoffs that there was &ldquo;little donor interest,&rdquo; but it was the uncertainty that his lawsuit created about the law&rsquo;s future that scared away donors.</p>
<p>The good news is that the court&rsquo;s decision clears the way for the scholarship program to achieve its full potential, expanding educational options for New Hampshire families.

<p>Nearly 60 years after Milton Friedman proposed a system of universal school choice in his seminal essay &ldquo;The Role of Government in Education,&rdquo; his vision is more popular than ever &mdash; and opponents of school choice are taking every measure to fight it.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="http://educationnext.org/files/2014ednextpoll.pdf" target="_blank">survey</a> by <em>Education Next</em>, half of those polled expressed support for universal school vouchers, and 60 percent favored giving tax credits for individual and corporate donations to scholarship organizations that help low- and middle-income families pay private-school tuition. Moreover, a recent Friedman Foundation <a href="http://educationnext.org/americans-want-choice-government-mandates/" target="_blank">survey</a> found that support for school-choice tax-credit laws was highest among groups that traditionally vote for Democrats, including low-income Americans (67 percent), younger people (74 percent), blacks (72 percent), and Hispanics (80 percent).</p>
<p>That popularity has translated into political success. The number of private-school choice programs has more than tripled in the last decade, from 15 in 2004 to <a href="http://www.edchoice.org/School-Choice/School-Choice-Programs" target="_blank">51 programs in 24 states and Washington, D.C., today</a>. In that time span, the number of students attending a private school with a voucher or tax-credit scholarship has grown from just under 100,000 to over 300,000.</p>
<p>Much of that growth has occurred in just the last few years. Since 2011, dubbed &ldquo;The Year of School Choice&rdquo; by the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304450604576420330972531442" target="_blank"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, states have adopted 24 new school-choice laws and expanded 33 existing choice programs. None have been legislatively repealed.</p>
<p>With school choice winning in state legislatures and the court of public opinion, opponents of choice have turned to the courts to stop them. Left-wing groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the teachers&rsquo; unions, and the Florida School Boards Association have filed a bevy of lawsuits in recent years to stem the school-choice tidal wave. Perversely, these organizations&rsquo; lawsuits would harm the very populations that they claim to want to help.</p>

<p>There are currently <a href="http://www.edchoice.org/Blog/September-2014/BRIEF--School-Choice-in-the-States-August-2014" target="_blank">active anti-school-choice lawsuits</a> in Alabama, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and North Carolina, plus two in Florida. Last month, a judge <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/school-choice-safe-florida-now" target="_blank">dismissed</a> a third lawsuit by the Florida Education Association because it could not demonstrate harm and therefore lacked standing. Lower courts in Oklahoma and North Carolina recently <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/why-tax-credits-survive-legal-challenges-vouchers-often-dont">struck down</a> those states&rsquo; special-needs voucher and low-income voucher, respectively. Those decisions are being appealed.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a federal judge <a href="http://blog.al.com/wire/2014/04/federal_judge_dismisses_lawsui.html" target="_blank">tossed out</a> a challenge to Alabama&rsquo;s school-choice law, which <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/splc-you-cant-help-every-child-you-cant-help-any-child" target="_blank">absurdly claimed</a> that the law violated the equal-protection clause because it failed to rescue all children from low-performing public schools. The judge held that the &ldquo;equal protection&rdquo; the plaintiffs sought was, &ldquo;in effect, equally bad treatment.&rdquo; A second <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/30_superintendents_join_lawsui.html" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> challenging Alabama&rsquo;s school-choice law on procedural grounds is pending appeal.</p>
<p>What follows is a summary of three of the main types of legal challenges that school-choice laws currently face.</p>
<p><strong>Blaine Amendment Challenges</strong><br />
The most common anti-school-choice legal challenge claims that such laws unconstitutionally fund religious education with public money.</p>
<p>In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court held in <em>Zelman v. Simmons-Harris</em> that school-voucher programs are consistent with the First Amendment&rsquo;s Establishment Clause when they serve a secular purpose and are neutral with respect to religion, and when aid goes to parents, who then choose where their child attends school. Thus any public money that flows to a religious institution does so only as a result of the choice of a child&rsquo;s parents. In this sense, a parent who uses a school voucher is constitutionally no different from a person who regularly hosts Bible studies in his Section 8 subsidized apartment or uses SNAP funds to purchase food for a religious feast.</p>
<p>Since this decision closed the door to challenges under the U.S. Constitution, opponents of school choice turned to the historically anti-Catholic &ldquo;Blaine Amendments&rdquo; contained in most state constitutions. During the late 19th century, Senator James Blaine of Maine, a nativist, sought to amend the U.S. Constitution to forbid state aid to religious schools, fearing that Catholic immigrants would want government funds for their parochial schools. At that time, public schools were de facto nondenominational Protestant schools. Though Blaine&rsquo;s effort was unsuccessful at the federal level, most states adopted some version of his proposed amendment, often in addition to an earlier constitutional provision prohibiting the &ldquo;compelled support&rdquo; of religion.</p>
<p>State supreme courts have differed in their interpretation of the Blaine Amendments. Some courts have closely tracked the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s First Amendment jurisprudence, as the Indiana Supreme Court did last year in <a href="http://ij.org/indiana-school-choice-release-3-26-2013" target="_blank">unanimously upholding</a> the state&rsquo;s voucher law. However, the Arizona Supreme Court had previously struck down two voucher laws under that state&rsquo;s Blaine Amendment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Arizona court upheld the state&rsquo;s school-choice tax-credit law because tax credits do not constitute public funds. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled likewise in <em>ACSTO v. Winn</em> (2011), holding that funds do not become &ldquo;public money&rdquo; until they have &ldquo;come into the tax collector&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo; In that sense, tax credits are constitutionally no different from tax deductions or exemptions. For example, no reasonable person believes that a church is &ldquo;publicly funded&rdquo; because its donors receive charitable-donation tax deductions or because the church itself receives a 100 percent property-tax exemption.</p>
<p>Last month, the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/live-free-learn-nh-supreme-court-upholds-school-choice" target="_blank">rejected a Blaine Amendment challenge</a> to the state&rsquo;s school-choice tax-credit law, holding that none of the plaintiffs had standing to sue since the law did not harm them. School-choice tax-credit laws have a perfect record so far in states&rsquo; high courts and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Arizona&rsquo;s education-savings-account law also <a href="http://watchdog.org/133941/school-choice-arizona/" target="_blank">survived</a> a Blaine Amendment challenge, despite the state supreme court&rsquo;s previous hostility toward vouchers. The court ruled that the law was constitutional because parents can spend the funds on a wide variety of educational expenses beyond tuition &mdash; and a significant number of families did not spend any of the funds on tuition.</p>
<p><strong>Uniformity-Clause Challenges</strong><br />
The Florida public-school establishment is <a href="http://educationnext.org/public-school-groups-sue-limit-publics-educational-options/" target="_blank">suing</a> to repeal the Sunshine State&rsquo;s 13-year-old school-choice tax credit and its new education savings accounts under the state&rsquo;s Blaine Amendment and its &ldquo;uniformity clause,&rdquo; which <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/Index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A9" target="_blank">mandates</a> that &ldquo;Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public schools. . . . &rdquo; The Florida Supreme Court previously struck down the state&rsquo;s voucher program under this provision in <em>Bush v. Holmes </em>(2006), on the grounds that the vouchers &ldquo;divert[ed] public dollars&rdquo; from &ldquo;the sole means set out in the Constitution for the state to provide for the education of Florida&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, the Florida Supreme Court interpreted &ldquo;uniform&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;exclusive.&rdquo; That reading would be strained even if not for the fact that the very same sentence of the Florida Constitution explicitly authorizes the state to create &ldquo;other public education programs that the needs of the people may require.&rdquo; Further straining credulity, the court interpreted the latter clause to refer only to junior colleges and adult-education programs.</p>
<p>Both the dissenters and two of the five justices in the <em>Holmes</em> majority have since been replaced, so it&rsquo;s unclear how the new bench is likely to rule. It remains to be seen whether it has the will to eliminate the nearly 70,000 scholarships going to mostly minority, low-income families.</p>
<p>Following the U.S. Supreme Court, the Florida Supreme Court may find that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the school-choice tax-credit law because it does not utilize public funds. Moreover, since the <em>Holmes</em> decision also interpreted &ldquo;uniform&rdquo; to mean that all schools must teach the same curriculum, it would appear to outlaw the state&rsquo;s public charter schools, which are not required by Florida statute to teach the state curriculum. The far-reaching consequences, combined with the fact that <em>Holmes</em> contradicts the plain meaning of the state constitution, may be enough to persuade the new bench to overturn or at least narrowly limit the <em>Holmes</em> precedent.</p>
<p><strong>Segregation Challenges</strong><br />
Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice attacked Louisiana&rsquo;s voucher law, claiming that it thwarted the DOJ&rsquo;s efforts to desegregate public schools. Ludicrously, the initial brief pointed to only <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/doj-lawsuit-would-keep-blacks-failing-schools" target="_blank">two examples</a>: a school that &ldquo;lost six black students as a result of the voucher program,&rdquo; thereby &ldquo;reinforcing the school&rsquo;s racial identity as a white school in a predominantly black school district,&rdquo; and a disproportionately black school that &ldquo;lost&rdquo; five white students. The shift in the racial makeup of each of these schools was less than 1 percent, yet that was too much for the racial bean counters at the DOJ.</p>
<p>Worse, Louisiana&rsquo;s vouchers were restricted to low-income families with children assigned to failing public schools. More than 85 percent of the voucher recipients were black. The <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-justice-department-bids-to-trap-poor-black-children-in-ineffective-schools/2013/09/01/2173e5a6-0f77-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_story.html" target="_blank">condemned</a> the DOJ&rsquo;s lawsuit as &ldquo;appalling,&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;rules to fight racism&rdquo; were being &ldquo;used to keep students in failing schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The absurdity of the DOJ&rsquo;s lawsuit was further exposed when <a href="http://educationnext.org/new-study-completely-undermines-doj%E2%80%99s-anti-school-choice-lawsuit/" target="_blank">two studies</a> by researchers at the University of Arkansas and Boston University revealed that the net effect of the voucher program was to improve racial integration. The DOJ eventually <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/doj-backpedals-school-choice-lawsuit" target="_blank">backpedaled</a> somewhat, dropping its demand that it have authority to approve or deny every single voucher, but a federal judge <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/court-louisiana-voucher-data-department-of-justice-bobby-jindal-105508.html" target="_blank">ruled</a> that the state must fork over data about the race of participating students, which the DOJ could use in future challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Future School-Choice Lawfare</strong><br />
Defenders of the public-school monopoly have had limited success in their lawfare against school choice, despite a few painful decisions. As the courts continue to uphold choice programs, opponents will likely shift to using <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2014/06/17/school-choice-fights-will-shift-to-regulation/" target="_blank">regulation</a> to strangle choice programs and turn to more targeted legal challenges, like the <a href="http://educationnext.org/school-choice-and-students-with-disabilities-in-milwaukee/" target="_blank">DOJ&rsquo;s threats</a> against Milwaukee&rsquo;s voucher program over special-needs enrollment. When crafting school-choice laws, wise legislators will consult in advance with the experts at the Institute for Justice, the Goldwater Institute, the Pacific Legal Foundation, or the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty to ensure that their legislation is well designed to withstand the inevitable legal challenge.</p>
<p>As ever, eternal vigilance is the price of educational liberty.</p>

<p>On Sept. 18, Rand Paul&#8217;s foreign policy address to the Senate ended with:</p>

<p>“ISIS is now a threat. Let&#8217;s get on with destroying them” (“Remarks Prepared for Delivery: Sen. Paul Delivers Foreign Policy Address,” paul.senate.gov, Sept. 18).</p>

<p>That should have been the first sentence of the speech, because until then he emphasized how chaotic the attempts to disable the expanding murderous regime of ISIS have been and how little we know about the rebels we are assisting: </p>

<p>“The idea that these rebels haven&#8217;t been armed before is ludicrous on its face. It is also ludicrous to believe that we know where all of the money, arms and ammunition will end up, or who will end up benefitting from these shipments &#8230; </p>

<p>“We don&#8217;t know for sure who the groups all are. Even when we think we do, loyalties shift and groups become amorphous, with alleged moderates lining up with jihadists.</p>

<p>“And finally, moderate groups have often sold their weapons or had them seized by the jihadist elements led by ISIS.”</p>

<p>Paul&#8217;s press release continues: “The German ambassador to the U.S. has fully admitted what our State Department tries to hide &mdash; that we can&#8217;t fully control the final destination of these arms.”</p>

<p>In this digital age, many Americans of both parties read speedily to cope with the torrent of news, views, debates, et al, and once they feel they grasp the overall message, they may not bother to finish the rest.</p>

<p>For those fast readers, the overall misapprehension of the bulk of Paul&#8217;s Senate address is that he is an isolationist in crucial foreign affairs &mdash; crises in which the U.S. should not intervene.</p>

<p>However, more careful readers of this revealing Senate address by Paul will find otherwise: “It&#8217;s not that I am against all intervention. I favor striking ISIS. I supported the decision to go to war with Afghanistan after our nation was attacked on 9/11. There are valid reasons for war. And importantly, there are ways to do it and ways not to do it.”</p>

<p>Early in his remarks, he explains his concerns with the methods used thus far in this particular intervention: “ISIS has grabbed up U.S., Saudi, Qatari weapons by the truckload, and we are now forced to fight against our own weapons &#8230; Reports show that the CIA, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have supplied roughly 600 tons of weapons to the militants in Syria in 2013 alone.”</p>

<p>He cites sources that show other countries are also sending weaponry to militants in Syria. But how much do we actually know about the nature and alliances of all the rebels in Syria?</p>

<p>Paul says: “Kuwaitis, a Sunni majority country bordering Iraq, have funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to a wide range of opposition forces both in Iraq and Syria, according to reports by the Brookings Institute &#8230; New York Times reports also detailed &#8230; huge arms and financial transfers from Qatar to the Syrian rebels, beginning as early as 2011.</p>

<p>“No one really knows where all that ended up: Jane&#8217;s Terrorism Center noted the transfer of Qatari arms to targeted groups has the same practical effect as shipping them to al-Nusra, a violent jihadi force.”</p>

<p>There&#8217;s more. Rand Paul moves on to President Obama&#8217;s perplexed approach to ISIS:</p>

<p>“Our Founding Fathers understood that the executive branch was the most prone to war, and so with due deliberation they gave the power to declare war to the legislative branch.</p>

<p>“President Obama&#8217;s new position, though, is that while he requests congressional input, he doesn&#8217;t necessarily need Congress’ approval.”</p>

<p>What? Obama has publicly repeated that he has a pen and he can act on his own.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Rand Paul reminds us what the reality is: “Even if Congress votes against it, the president still believes that he reserves the right to involve our soldiers in a war unilaterally.”</p>

<p>We know that Rand Paul will follow the Constitution if he&#8217;s our next president. In last month&#8217;s address to the Senate, he specifically reminds the rest of Congress: “Article l, Section 8, Clause 11 gives Congress &mdash; and Congress alone &mdash; the power to declare war. If Congress does not approve the military action, the president must abide by that decision.”</p>

<p>Hear that, Mr. Obama?</p>

<p>I keep calling for the due process impeachment of the president for this and the many other reasons I have documented in previous columns. But everyone I ask, including those who agree with me, assure me that it&#8217;s not going to happen. </p>

<p>Obviously, therefore, while the president now sounds more “militant” against ISIS (without our “putting boots on the ground”), the dismal likelihood is that the hideous reign of ISIS and its increasingly eager progeny will continue until the next president and Congress move decisively &mdash; forget the gossamer United Nations &mdash; to restore the possibility of human rights prevailing on this planet.</p>

<p>Rand Paul summarizes: “We will fight ISIS, a war I accept as necessary, largely because our own arms and the arms of our allies in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar have enabled our new enemy ISIS. Will we ever learn? &#8230;</p>

<p>“We must protect ourselves from radical Islam, but we should never, ever have armed radical Islam, and we could make it worse by arming it more today!</p>

<p>“We have enabled the enemy we must now confront.”</p>

<p>I have frequently demonstrated that of all probable candidates for the presidency, Rand Paul is the most deeply knowledgeable inhabitant of our Constitution.</p>

<p>He is also, potentially, one of the most effective enemies of ISIS.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s up to us to decide what will become of America and the rest of the world in the 2016 elections &mdash; including who&#8217;ll eventually be on the Supreme Court and whether our kids will learn how to be Americans according to this thing called the Constitution.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s up to Rand Paul to get his messages and warnings across more decisively. A lot of us need to be awakened as to why we are here.</p>

<p>After years of pursuing hard-line policies toward many of its East Asian neighbors, China has shown signs in recent months of embracing a more conciliatory approach. One clear indicator was Beijing&rsquo;s decision to withdraw a controversial oil drilling rig in disputed waters near the Vietnam coast. At the same time, Chinese officials adopted a decidedly less confrontational tone toward Hanoi regarding the broader territorial disputes between the two countries in the South China Sea. Instead of emphasizing China&rsquo;s alleged historical and legal rights to widespread swaths in that body of water, Beijing stated that such bilateral controversies can and should be addressed through concerted diplomacy.</p>
<p>Hanoi is not the only recipient of such conciliatory gestures. Xi Jinping&rsquo;s government has conducted a noticeable charm offensive toward South Korea. Just a few years ago, Beijing continued to support its communist North Korean ally without much criticism. That stance even included countenancing Pyongyang&rsquo;s aggressive policy toward its southern neighbor&mdash;a point that became all too apparent in March 2010 when the Chinese government declined to condemn North Korea&rsquo;s sinking of the South Korean naval vessel Cheonan. Frictions also surfaced in late 2013 after Beijing proclaimed an air defense identification zone between the Chinese mainland and both Japan and South Korea. Seoul joined with Washington and Tokyo in strongly condemning that move as an unacceptable attempt to interfere with air travel rights.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>China&rsquo;s actions toward South Korea have been markedly different in 2014. Beijing has taken steps to distance its policies from those of Pyongyang, including issuing thinly veiled warnings to Kim Jong-un&rsquo;s regime not to disturb the peace and stability of East Asia. Xi followed those steps with a summit visit to Seoul, in which he emphasized the mutual benefits of closer political and economic ties between China and South Korea. Highlighting the courtship of Seoul, Xi ostentatiously snubbed Kim Jong-un&rsquo;s government by declining to stop in Pyongyang either before or after his journey to Seoul.</p>
<p>Beijing has even put out cautious feelers to India and Japan for better relations. Chinese officials recently stressed that there was no need for a crisis involving the long-disputed border with India&mdash;a flashpoint that exploded into a full-fledged war in 1962. Xi&rsquo;s government also dialed back its confrontational policy toward Tokyo, stressing the importance of continued economic links between the two countries.</p>
<p>The general tone of China&rsquo;s foreign policy is noticeably less strident and confrontational than it was just a year ago. True, not all capitals have received equal measures of Chinese conciliation. For example, Beijing has shown little willingness to compromise with Manila regarding their territorial dispute involving the South China Sea. And the Chinese government&rsquo;s stance toward Taiwan even seems to have hardened slightly in recent months. Still, there is little doubt that Beijing&rsquo;s overall approach to its neighbors is now less abrasive.</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear why such a course correction has taken place, much less why it has done so at this time. There appear to be two possible explanations.</p>
<p>One is that Beijing is simply continuing a long-term strategy of alternating periods of assertiveness with periods of accommodation. We have certainly seen such patterns before. In its policy toward Taiwan, for example, the Chinese government pursued a highly confrontational, uncompromising approach from the communist revolution in 1949 until the late 1980s. A more conciliatory policy then emerged in the early 1990s. During that period, Chinese and Taiwanese negotiators came up with the formula that while both sides agreed there was only one China, they had different interpretations of what that concept meant. The period of cautious accommodation ended abruptly in 1995, when in response to signs of rising pro-independence sentiment on the island, Beijing repeatedly conducted provocative naval exercises in the Taiwan Strait and issued pointed warnings that it reserved the right to use military force if such &ldquo;splitist&rdquo; behavior continued. That hard-line stance continued throughout the administration of Taiwanese leader Chen Shui-bian, but a new period of conciliation emerged in 2008 in response to the election of the more pro-mainland Ma Ying–jeou as Chen&rsquo;s successor.</p>
<p>Although Beijing&rsquo;s current, softer approach in East Asia may just reflect a similar, &ldquo;cyclical&rdquo; policy dynamic, there is another possibility. Chinese leaders may have calculated that they overreached with their highly assertive actions, especially those regarding the South China Sea and East China Sea, during the previous four or five years. There were ample signs of blowback against that policy. Not only did the United States announce a &ldquo;rebalancing&rdquo; of its military forces to the western Pacific, but Washington worked assiduously to draw East Asian nations into a de facto containment policy directed against China. Such nations as Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam responded favorably to the U.S. moves, and there were even indications of greater security cooperation among various regional powers. China&rsquo;s nemesis, Japan, was often at the center of such initiatives, playing a much more active security role than at any time since the end of World War II.</p>
<p>China has every incentive to try to disrupt a possible web of informal alliances designed to constrain its power. The charm offensive should be viewed in that larger context. The key question, though, is whether Beijing&rsquo;s recent enthusiasm for more cooperative diplomacy merely reflects a short-term tactical shift or a long-term prudent adjustment. The primary argument for the former interpretation is that, as much as China&rsquo;s leaders are no longer communist in terms of economic policy, they remain committed Leninists when it comes to political strategy. One important Leninist maxim is that if one plunges in a bayonet and encounters soft resistance, continue to press, but if one encounters steel, pull back. Chinese leaders may have concluded that their previous initiatives had encountered steel from the United States and a growing roster of both formal and informal U.S. allies. However, it is also possible that those leaders concluded that the ongoing, ultra-assertive approach was counterproductive, and that if China wanted to preserve peace and continue to enjoy the vast economic benefits of being part of the global community, a permanent policy shift was required.</p>
<p>We may not have a definitive answer about the reasons for Beijing&rsquo;s charm offensive for years. The early signs, though, are at least marginally encouraging. The United States and its allies should be careful to respond favorably to China&rsquo;s more accommodating policy and not needlessly press Beijing or create renewed tensions.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, minimum wage workers protesting their low-wage status have marched in the streets in more than 100 U.S. cities. For example, workers in Charleston SC <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20140904/PC05/140909765" target="_blank">blocked a main thoroughfare</a>, insisting they be paid $15/hr and receive union membership.</p>
<p>Supported by President Obama, who is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/us/politics/obama-takes-to-road-to-push-rise-in-minimum-wage.html?_r=0" target="_blank">pushing to raise</a> the current $7.25 per hour federal minimum to $10.10, other alert politicians are cheering the call for higher federal mandates. After all, if protesters can be converted to mid-term election voters, some now-discouraged office seekers may be successful in the November vote.</p>
<p>Indeed, everyone from politicians to clerical leaders to even fast food CEO&rsquo;s have jumped on the minimum wage bandwagon. What accounts for this recent bout of mutual sympathy for the working poor? To answer this question, we turn briefly to our Bootlegger/Baptist theory, a theory that explains why politics can attract such strange bedfellows.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Bootlegger/Baptist theory therefore reminds us that properly crafted regulations can more than provide publicly popular goals but also eliminate competition, raise rivals costs, and attract patronage and revenues to favored groups.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The theory is based on the old story of Baptists and bootleggers who both favor Sunday closing laws that shutter corner liquor stores. Enforcement of the law gives solace to the Baptists and income to the bootleggers who eliminate competition just one day a week. Bootlegger/Baptist theory therefore reminds us that properly crafted regulations can more than provide publicly popular goals but also eliminate competition, raise rivals costs, and attract patronage and revenues to favored groups.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a closer look at our Bootlegger/Baptist groups in the context of the struggle for increasing the minimum wage. There in the amen corner are the Catholic bishops who in Senate testimony <a href="http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/labor-employment/upload/Testimony-Bishop-Blaire-to-HELP-Committee-on-Minimum-Wage-2013-06-25.pdf" target="_blank">endorsed a higher wage</a>: &ldquo;Every time Congress or an Administration has suggested raising the minimum wage, the bishops have been supportive simply because it is consistent with our teaching and we see the effects first hand in the families of our parishioners and our own communities.&rdquo; Joining the chorus, are the United Methodist Church and other protestant denominations. Indeed, it is impossible to find a religious organization that opposes paying higher wages to low-income workers.</p>
<p>But not all the pro-higher wage leaders wear clerical collars, even though they may at times employ righteous rhetoric. The AFL-CIO is a strong advocate for a higher minimum wage, though none of its members earn such low wages. Similarly, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/04/mcdonalds-ceo-minimum-wage-hike_n_5445539.html" target="_blank">CEO of McDonald&rsquo;s</a> along with operators of some big-box stores are also counted among those who favor a higher federal minimum, or at least do not oppose the legislation.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304908304579563763405679116" target="_blank">speaking for 1.3 million employees</a>, of which only 5,000 earn the federal minimum wage, Wal-Mart U.S. President Bill Simon said &ldquo;We are not opposed to minimum wage increase, unless it&rsquo;s directed exclusively at us.&rdquo; He was referring to an effort by the District of Columbia to require just big-box retailers to pay starting wages that are higher than Washington&rsquo;s minimum wage. Starbucks, GAP, Ikeda, and Chipotle are supporting a higher minimum and in some cases have already raised their starting wage.</p>
<p>But why would national labor organizations, McDonald&rsquo;s CEO&rsquo;s and big-box retailors be lobbying for higher minimum wages, especially when few if any of their members or employees earn such low wages in the first place? We detect the air of the Bootlegger in their behavior. By increasing the minimum wage, the real impact will be on their competitors who do employ low wage workers. While their competitors are forced to increase their labor costs through a combination of higher pay and forced layoffs, the Bootleggers quietly rake in the profit.</p>
<p>Consider the AFL-CIO. The union is a Bootlegger, eager to add members to its diminished flock. Supporting fast food workers in their struggle for higher wages and for the right to organize could yield a significant pay off. Add to this the effect of higher minimum wages on firms that compete with unionized businesses, which usually pay well above this threshold. Simply put, a higher minimum reduces competition for them.</p>
<p>A similar story plays out for McDonald&rsquo;s, Wal-Mart and other retailers who already pay more than the federal minimum wage. They are Bootleggers too, supporting a federal rule that pushes wages higher for all retailers in a way that will inevitably raise rivals&rsquo; cost.</p>
<p>In summary, President Obama is the leading &ldquo;Baptist&rdquo; on the minimum wage struggle. He takes the high ground. The Catholic bishops, Methodists, and other clerics join in singing the Baptist tunes. Meanwhile, Bootleggers echo these sentiments but for very different reasons. They care less for the struggle of the poor and more for their rivalry with low cost competitors.</p>
<p>The real tragedy is that few if any of the vocal participants are asking how a higher minimum wage will actually affect the poor and unskilled teenagers who are already challenged when seeking a job. Surely a reduction in the number of jobs available is a dire consequence for this group. But then, unemployed, nonvoting teenagers do not count for much in the land of Bootleggers & Baptists.</p>

Tanner</p>


<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when the United States was considered the world standard for economic freedom. Yes, there were countries out there, like Hong Kong and Singapore, that might have had lower taxes or fewer regulations. But the world could still speak confidently of the American free-enterprise system. No longer.</p>
<p>This week, a consortium of think tanks from almost 90 countries released their <em><a href="http://www.cato.org/economic-freedom-world">Economic Freedom of the World Report</a></em>. The United States is no longer among the top ten countries when it comes to size of government, rule of law and property rights, soundness of the money supply, regulation, and free trade. We now rank twelfth, down from second as recently as 2000. For the record, we now trail Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Australia, Jordan, Chile, and Finland.</p>
<p>Our economic situation looks even darker when one examines the individual components that made up our overall ranking. Americans may be aghast at the big governments of Europe, but we actually rank 46th in the world using the so-called &ldquo;chain-linked&rdquo; rankings. Our government is not yet as big, relative to population, as France&rsquo;s (ranked 113th) or Italy&rsquo;s (115th), but we are headed in that direction if we don&rsquo;t change our ways. Already we rank below Brazil and even Mexico.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">By measures such as size of government, rule of law, and free trade, we&#8217;re out of the top ten.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor are we a bastion of free trade; we now rank 29th worldwide. Of particular concern, the soundness of our money continues to erode. As recently as 2005, we were an unsurprising number one. Today, after years of quantitative easing, we&rsquo;ve slipped to 38th.</p>
<p>Even more frightening, in 1980, when the report was first issued, the U.S. legal system and our respect for property rights were the world&rsquo;s best. In 2000, we still ranked in the top ten. Today, we have fallen to 36th, trailing countries like Malaysia, Namibia, and Cyprus. That&rsquo;s pretty poor company. Among the reasons cited for this precipitous decline are the increased use of eminent domain to seize private property for public use (and often for the benefit of powerful political interests), increased property seizures resulting from the wars on terrorism and drugs, and violation of the property rights of bondholders in the automakers&rsquo; bailout. Overall, the report concludes that the United States &ldquo;experienced a significant move away from rule of law and toward a highly regulated, politicized, and heavily policed state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only on regulation did we squeak into the top ten. But even here the deterioration is significant. In 2000, before George W. Bush took office, we ranked second.</p>
<p>Of course, we can take comfort that we are not as badly off as Venezuela, which ranked dead last among the 152 nations considered. Other countries in the bottom ten included: the Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Algeria, Iran, Chad, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Myanmar. Still, we should probably shoot for something a little higher than not being Chad.</p>
<p>Bad as this report is, it may actually understate our worsening condition. Most of the report&rsquo;s data come from 2012. Given the trajectory of governmental growth over the last two years (Obamacare, anyone?), next year&rsquo;s report is likely to look even worse.</p>
<p>Nor is this report the only indication that our economy is far from free. For example, Transparency International ranks the U.S. 19th on its Corruption Perceptions Index. While this ranking is distorted by the organization&rsquo;s antipathy to our campaign-finance laws, it also demonstrates increasing corruption and venality among our elected officials. On the World Bank&rsquo;s Ease of Doing Business Index, we do better, but we still trail Singapore, Hong Kong, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>It has long been pointed out that the United States has the highest business-tax rates among industrialized countries. And a broader look at overall business-tax competitiveness by KPMG ranked the U.S. behind such nations as Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>There are very real consequences to the decline in U.S. economic freedom. The report makes very clear that there is a strong correlation between economic freedom and economic growth. For example, the quartile of countries rated most economically free had an average GDP per capita of $39,899. The least free quartile averaged just $6,253. Economic growth among the most free countries averaged 3.43 percent, compared to just 2.55 percent for those ranked least free. Freer countries also perform better on measures ranging from life expectancy to the amount of income earned by the poorest citizens. The authors conclude that &ldquo;unless policies undermining economic freedom are reversed, the future annual growth of the U.S. economy will be only about half its historic average of 3 percent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, while this report looked only at economic freedom (which is why Hong Kong and Singapore scored so high), the United States&rsquo; growing surveillance state, the ongoing wars on drugs and terror, police militarization, and the increasingly intrusive regulatory bureaucracy raise important questions about civil liberties and civil rights as well.</p>
<p>We should not get too excited over the year-to-year fluctuations in these rankings. But the broad long-term trend has become ominous. The U.S. is steadily becoming less free. Like the frog in the proverbial slowly heating pot of water, we might not have noticed. But unless we reverse course soon, the consequences may be inescapable.</p>

<p>The Obama administration has been busily building an international coalition to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). It is an assemblage that is questionable in terms of both image and substance. At this writing, some 40 nations have joined the coalition, but most of them are little more than paper members offering their best wishes to the United States and a few U.S. allies that will do the overwhelming majority of the military work. Even some supposedly prominent participants show little enthusiasm or cooperation. Ankara, for example, has already refused to participate in combat operations and has even barred the United States from using bases in Turkey to launch air strikes.</p>
<p>The most questionable coalition partner, though, is Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it should be most awkward for Washington and the other Western powers to ally with that country for missions against ISIL. There was understandable revulsion throughout the international community when videos surfaced of ISIL executing Iraqi military prisoners. Then came the even more horrifying images documenting the beheading of two American journalists and a British humanitarian aid worker. But ISIL is not the only perpetrator of such barbarity. In 2014 alone, Saudi Arabia has executed 46 people through beheadings&mdash;nearly half of them for nonviolent offenses. Yet Western leaders express muted criticism, at most, of their ally&rsquo;s odious conduct.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Western leaders badly need to reassess their assumptions about Riyadh&#8217;s motives and probable actions.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equally troubling, Saudi Arabia bears considerable responsibility for the rise of ISIL in the first place. Riyadh (along with Ankara) enthusiastically backed the insurgents in Syria that have been trying to overthrow the government of Bashar al-Assad. A large portion of Saudi aid, though, went to radical factions that subsequently formed the core of ISIL. It should not have been a surprise that Riyadh lavished much of its assistance on anti-democratic, ultra-religious elements, given the royal family&rsquo;s long-standing record of promoting the extremist Wahhabi strain of Islam throughout the Muslim world.</p>
<p>Saudi leaders may now realize that their conduct helped create a Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster in the form of ISIL. But Washington&rsquo;s assumption that Riyadh, as member of the anti-ISIL coalition, will promote and strengthen &ldquo;moderates&rdquo; in Syria and Iraq is a case of wishful thinking. It is far more likely that Saudi Arabia will seek to empower competing hard-line Sunni Arab factions in those countries&mdash;factions that are willing to break with ISIL and instead accept guidance (and probably financial largesse) from their Saudi patrons. Moreover, although Riyadh likely wants to marginalize ISIL, it hardly wishes to crush the organization and thereby benefit either Sunni secular factions or Shiite Iran and its allies in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Obama administration and other Western governments seem unwilling to acknowledge that a key member of the coalition they are building against ISIL is both unsavory and duplicitous. But the participation of Saudi Arabia may undermine the goals of the anti-ISIL mission even before the campaign gains momentum. Western leaders badly need to reassess their assumptions about Riyadh&rsquo;s motives and probable actions. It does the allied powers no credit to make common cause with such a repulsive regime.</p>

<p>Unless you follow education policy closely, you probably don&rsquo;t know who Representative John Kline is. But just a few weeks ago, lefty talk-show host and comedian Bill Maher declared the district of the Minnesota Republican his top target for flipping from red to blue. Why? First and foremost, because Kline chairs the House Education and Workforce Committee and gets donations from, apparently, the worst villains this side of the Joker and Lex Luthor: for-profit colleges.</p>
<p>After running through a parade of horribles perpetrated by Kline &mdash; opposing Obamacare, Planned Parenthood funding, etc. &mdash; Maher stated that Kline is at his worst on higher education, especially because he &ldquo;is the champion of for-profit colleges, which they used to call diploma mills, but that&rsquo;s back when you at least got a diploma.&rdquo; Then he really zinged the schools: &ldquo;These are not real colleges. Real colleges have leafy quads and libraries, and hippie professors who turn nice Christian kids into bisexual atheists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maher is not alone in attacking proprietary schools. For the last several years, Senate education committee chairman Tom Harkin (D., Iowa) has hunted the for-profit sector as if it were his white whale, holding slanted hearings, issuing a damning report, and generally railing against the colleges. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Education has been pushing &ldquo;gainful employment&rdquo; regulations, due to be finalized in the coming months, specifically targeting for-profit schools. And then there are state attorneys general, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who have launched several splashy investigations into proprietary colleges.</p>
<p>So are for-profits truly awful? At least, do they perform worse than the thousands of putatively nonprofit institutions sporting the leafy quads and Christian-flipping profs that Cornell grad Maher and so many others seem to think essential to higher education?</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">For-profits colleges make great scapegoats for politicians whose huge subsidy programs are a major cause of rampant price inflation and fruitless college enrollment.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are certainly reasons for concern.</p>
<p>A major one is the sector&rsquo;s high federal student-loan default rate. According to the most recent numbers, 19 percent of students at for-profit schools had defaulted within three years of entering repayment, versus 13 percent at public institutions and 7 percent at private, nonprofit institutions.</p>
<p>Their completion rates aren&rsquo;t stellar, either. According to the federal <em>Digest of Education Statistics</em>, the latest six-year completion rate for people in four-year programs is a cringe-inducing 32 percent. Finally, there&rsquo;s the cost: According to the College Board, which produces annual reports on college prices and aid, the average cost of tuition and fees at for-profit institutions was $15,130 last year. That was 70 percent higher than the state-resident price at an average four-year public college, though only about half the cost of a four-year, nonprofit private school.</p>
<p>All this looks pretty bad for for-profit colleges. But here&rsquo;s the thing: Public and not-for-profit private schools also produce atrocious results. This is especially true when you try to pinpoint students with demographics similar to those at for-profit schools: generally older, lower-income people who were less likely to be on a college-prep track in high school.</p>
<p>Consider completion rates again. When you compare for-profits with public colleges with noncompetitive admissions &mdash; the schools most likely dealing with similar types of students &mdash; for-profits equal or outperform them.</p>
<p>The six-year graduation rate for open-enrollment public schools is the same as for proprietary four-year programs: 32 percent. For African Americans, the for-profits beat their competition. Twenty-one percent at for-profits completed their programs within six years, compared with 18 percent at open-admissions public institutions.</p>
<p>The numbers are starker when you look at two-year institutions. For-profits see 63 percent of students complete within 150 percent of the time a program is supposed to take. For public two-year institutions, the figure is a minuscule 20 percent. Among African Americans, the difference is 53 percent to 11 percent.</p>
<p>There are problems with these data &mdash; they include only first-time, full-time students who finish at the institution where they started &mdash; but they are the best available, and at the very least they strongly suggest that for-profits do as good a job or better of moving their types of students to graduation than do public colleges.</p>
<p>But do the resulting credentials translate into increased earnings?</p>
<p>Again, there are no broad, systematic data on outcomes, so it is impossible to control for all the factors needed to isolate the effects of schools versus student characteristics. However, one study using federal data, conducted by the Parthenon Group but funded by embattled Corinthian Colleges, suggested that enrolling in a two-year-or-less for-profit program generated greater short-term gains than did doing the same at a two-year public institution. For-profit students saw a $7,900 jump in annual earnings versus $7,300 for those who graduated from community colleges, though from a baseline of just $14,700, versus $20,300 for community-college students.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more powerful indicator of success than questionable earnings data is that enrollment in proprietary schools has grown at a pace eclipsing that in the other higher-education sectors. According to the most recent data, between 1992 and 2012 enrollment at for-profit schools grew nearly eightfold &mdash; from 230,269 students to 1,808,898 &mdash; while at private nonprofits and public colleges it rose by only a third.</p>
<p>Apparently, for-profit schools are providing something many people want, and unless you assume people are shockingly irrational, that is an important sign of relative effectiveness. And again, you have to see for-profit schools in context to understand their draw.</p>
<p>Proprietary schools are typically unadorned operations found in strip malls, office buildings, and online, offering flexible schedules and frequent enrollment periods. They are intended to be places where you can get the skills or credential you need, quickly, because you&rsquo;ve got kids and a job to worry about. Meanwhile, traditional colleges are geared toward, well, traditional students: just-out-of-high-school kids whose primary job is to go to school.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe &ldquo;job&rdquo; is misleading. More than just the leafy quads of Maher U, today these institutions offer amenities ranging from first-run movie theaters to rock concerts to recreation facilities differing from a Carnival Cruise only in that the college is on land. On land, that is, unless you are on a &ldquo;Semester at Sea,&rdquo; sunbathing at the University of Missouri&rsquo;s &ldquo;Truman&rsquo;s Pond,&rdquo; or floating through Texas Tech&rsquo;s $8.4-million &ldquo;leisure pool&rdquo; complete with a meandering &ldquo;lazy river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, college prices have infamously skyrocketed as traditional students have demanded more amenities and as schools have grabbed for cash.  And who has furnished much of the inflationary fuel? The very politicians who devote so much energy to attacking for-profits. According to the College Board, inflation-adjusted federal student aid leapt from $38 billion in the 1992–93 academic year to $170 billion in 2012–13, a blistering 347 percent increase.</p>
<p>And just because they are called &ldquo;nonprofit,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t think traditional schools don&rsquo;t bring in far more money than it costs to educate most undergraduates. According to a Cato Institute analysis by Oklahoma State University professor Vance Fried, once donations and state subsidies are factored in &mdash; two huge revenue streams that for-profits don&rsquo;t have &mdash; public research universities make profits of around $11,000 per student, and private, nonprofit schools nearly $13,000. The only reason this isn&rsquo;t called &ldquo;profit&rdquo; is that, rather than sending it to investors, schools keep it in the form of higher salaries, more employees, new amenities, and so on.</p>
<p>Which brings us to perhaps the primary reason that for-profits have been under such focused assault: They make great scapegoats for politicians whose huge subsidy programs are a major cause of rampant price inflation and fruitless college enrollment. Rather than address their poisonous but popular aid programs, politicians point to those who dare openly seek a profit and declare, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the witch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But ignoring the real problem won&rsquo;t make it go away. And contra Bill Maher, the problem isn&rsquo;t too many leafless, quad-less, for-profit colleges. It is far too much taxpayer money throughout the ivory tower, and there&rsquo;s nothing funny about that.</p>

<p>Hong Kong is part of China, but enjoys a charmed existence. Administered separately from the rest of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, the territory respects civil liberties while hosting the world&rsquo;s freest economy. But democratic Hong Kong is not.</p>
<p>Demonstrators are pressing Beijing to make good on its promise to Great Britain to provide what London never did while the territory was a British colony: democratic rule and free elections. But the PRC will not, indeed, cannot, give residents of Hong Kong what it refuses to give the rest of its citizens. The city&rsquo;s future depends on finding a compromise that preserves Hong Kong&rsquo;s freedom and peace.</p>
<p>The British colony grew out of Imperial China&rsquo;s weakness. As the empire fell from dominance to irrelevance Great Britain seized territory. Portugal did the same with Macau, a short distance away.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s imperialist land grab redounded to the benefit of Hong Kong&rsquo;s residents. China was badly ruled even while independent. The country suffered through foreign intervention, revolution, war lords, Japanese invasion, civil war, and Communist control. In contrast, people in Hong Kong prospered, enjoying economic liberty, rule of law, and civil liberties. All they had to sacrifice was democracy, which they wouldn&rsquo;t have had in China, and certainly not under the PRC.</p>
<p>Alas, all good things come to an end, at least when it comes to foreign policy. Great Britain took three bites at the apple: it seized Hong Kong Island, then the Kowloon Peninsula, and later &ldquo;leased&rdquo; the New Territories. In 1997 the latter&rsquo;s 99-year term ran out. At which point Beijing was legally entitled to take back the New Territories.</p>
<p>Dividing Hong Kong would have been a practical nightmare. And Beijing might not have continued to honor territorial cessions forced more than a century before. So in 1984 Britain&rsquo;s famed Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, agreed to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which committed her government to the full territory&rsquo;s return.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Nothing the U.S. does can bring democracy to the territory.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The transfer left one of history&rsquo;s great &ldquo;What ifs&rdquo;? What if Prime Minister Thatcher announced that even though the initial land grab was unjust, the result was a unique political community independent of the PRC? The territory never had been subject to the mainland&rsquo;s communist government, two revolutions away from the imperial court which yielded Hong Kong to London. What if the Thatcher government went on to explain it was scheduling a referendum in which the territory&rsquo;s residents could freely express their decision: join the PRC, remain British, or become independent?</p>
<p>Few likely would have opted for Beijing. China in 1997 was very different from that ruled by Mao Zedong, who died 21 years before. But the PRC still was a poor, authoritarian state, early in the process of economic reform. None of Hong Kong&rsquo;s residents could remember life under China. Today barely one-fifth of the city&rsquo;s 7.2 million residents even identify as &ldquo;Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time a still weak and isolated Beijing probably would have felt little choice but to accept an adverse vote. However, such a strategy would have inflamed the PRC&rsquo;s desire to reverse prior injustices. China might have chosen to bide its time, as it has done with Taiwan. Then Hong Kong today would be another fractious, potentially violent, territorial dispute in East Asia.</p>
<p>While returning Hong Kong was Britain&rsquo;s safe course, doing so meant transferring millions of people to communist China. The PRC committed to respect Hong Kong&rsquo;s uniqueness for a half century. So far the denizens of Zhongnanhai have fulfilled their promises. A friend of mine&mdash;a lifelong resident who preferred continued British rule and feared the Chinese takeover&mdash;reluctantly admitted that Beijing largely had kept its hands off. Indeed, he argued, the British authorities actually were more likely to call a critical journalist. Obviously, there remains cause for concern: for instance, advertising boycotts have punished papers deemed too critical of Beijing. However, the territory still is remarkably free.</p>
<p>The PRC also kept the letter if not the spirit of its agreement regarding Hong Kong&rsquo;s political system. Beijing never promised to hold fully free elections. Rather, the 1984 declaration stated: &ldquo;The chief executive will be appointed by the Central People&rsquo;s Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally.&rdquo; Thus, even if London could enforce the pact painstakingly negotiated with China, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The Basic Law (essentially the territory&rsquo;s constitution), approved six years later by Beijing, provided for &ldquo;nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures.&rdquo;  The PRC claims that is what it is implementing. As of 2017 residents will be able to elect their ruler, but only from candidates vetted by Beijing. It won&rsquo;t be real democracy, but then, there never was much chance that the Chinese Communist Party would institute real democracy in any area under its control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fair to Hong Kong&rsquo;s residents. But fairness has little to do with international politics. After all, people living in Hong Kong generally are more prosperous and freer than anyone else in China. The press and internet are not censored. Most anyone can travel to and from Hong Kong. Demonstrators act without fear of a brutal crackdown. So far, at least.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible not to admire the protestors, who took over much of a central city district. However, the demonstrators&rsquo; very passion threatens their objective. They have divided over tactics, while paralyzing city life, thereby sparking criticism from some other residents. Even many who sympathize with the protestors fear a crackdown. Pro-Beijing elements responded with violence; the authorities, city and/or Beijing, were suspected of enlisting Triad (criminal) gangs to do the dirty work.</p>
<p>However, the greater risk is that the Chinese leadership, which fears political instability at home, might believe it must choose between repression and either chaos or democracy. To Beijing, Hong Kong is not just Hong Kong, but an element of China&rsquo;s overall security. Violent protests and strikes already are common&mdash;numbering in the tens of thousands annually&mdash;in the mainland, especially in nearby Guandong province. Seventeen-year-old Joshua Wong, one of the best known student leaders, said: &ldquo;We are not seeking revolution. We just want democracy.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s not clear Beijing sees the difference. In 1989 the CCP sent in tanks to clear democracy-minded demonstrators out of Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>Beijing would pay an even higher price for cracking down in Hong Kong. With unfettered media and internet freedom, any bloodshed would be transmitted around the world. Business and capital would flee.  Repression would undercut Beijing&rsquo;s attempt to conciliate Taiwan.  Still, Hong Kong matters far less economically to the PRC today than in 1997. And the CCP places self-preservation above everything else.</p>
<p>Moreover, if China violently dispersed the protestors, it would not likely stop there. Media freedom and judicial independence also would be at risk. Under Britain Hong Kong illustrated how liberty could exist without democracy. The PRC would not hesitate to highlight how destroying liberty could prevent democracy. It would be foolhardy for demonstrators to risk the territory&rsquo;s uniqueness in a Quixotic attempt to force Beijing to accept in Hong Kong what it used force to suppress in the rest of China.</p>
<p>This week crowds thinned and demonstrators cleared a path for government workers. The tension further eased as demonstrators and government officials agreed to talks. Democracy advocates should temper their idealism with an acute sense of pragmatism. Beijing might sacrifice the territory&rsquo;s chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, to gain peace. Zhongnanhai also might be willing to make other concessions, such as broadening the nomination process, so long as it retained ultimate control. Indeed, public protests in 2003 and 2012, respectively, caused the PRC to back down on proposals to enact an authoritarian &ldquo;security&rdquo; law and mandate &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; education. But those were peripheral issues compared to democracy in a territory governed by Beijing. The PRC will insist that Chinese officials, not Hong Kong residents, be in charge.</p>
<p>Nothing the U.S. does can bring democracy to the territory. To the contrary, the more Washington attempts to intervene, the more likely China is to believe the demonstrators to be threats. Beijing has blamed the protests on Western &ldquo;meddling.&rdquo; Moreover, Zhongnanhai&rsquo;s residents already perceive the U.S. to be engaged in an attempt to contain the PRC, for instance supporting Japan and the Philippines in their territorial disputes. Beijing would treat as more provocative American intervention in what even U.S. officials acknowledge to be part of China. Washington should privately warn Beijing that a violent crackdown would damage the PRC economically, diplomatically, and politically. But U.S. officials should not try to dictate any particular electoral system, especially publicly. Doing so would make compromise in Hong Kong even more difficult to reach.</p>
<p>The demonstrators have moral right on their side. They understandably worry that that lack of democratic rights places their other liberties at risk. And whatever happens they have changed the territory. Observed billionaire publisher Jimmy Lai, residents formerly were like diners forced to eat anything served by Beijing, but &ldquo;Now they are all in the kitchen cooking for themselves.&rdquo; The people of Hong Kong deserve the world&rsquo;s admiration and support.</p>
<p>Still, raw power is likely to prevail in any showdown. &ldquo;One nation, two systems,&rdquo; obviously can mean different things, but even without democracy Hong Kong residents enjoy significant liberty. Beijing might pay a price to peacefully end the protests which have convulsed the city. But Chinese officials almost certainly would pay a much higher price to avoid chaos or democracy. The protestors must not allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good for their own sake&mdash;and ultimately that of Hong Kong and China as well.</p>

<p>The Great Recession ended in 2009, but its effects are still being felt within state budgets. To close the gap between higher spending and lower-than-expected government revenues, governors took varying approaches. Some, like North Carolina&#8217;s Governor Pat McCrory, cut spending and taxes to breathe new life into their economies. Others, like California Governor Jerry Brown, increased taxes on families and businesses and expanded the government, hampering the Golden State&#8217;s competitiveness.</p>
<p>Cato Institute&#8217;s 12th biennial edition of its “Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&#8217;s Governors” assigns grades of “A” to “F” to the governors based on their efforts to restrain government. Not only did Governor Brown receive an “F” in this year&#8217;s report card, he received the worst score of any governor.</p>
<p>So, why did Governor Brown score so poorly?</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Governor Brown&#8217;s policies are moving California in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To start, Brown has pushed for several large tax increases. In 2012 he championed a plan to increase annual tax revenues by $6 billion a year. That increase, which passed on a November 2012 ballot, included a hike in the top individual income tax rate to 13.3 percent. </p>
<p>He also supported a $1 per pack increase in cigarette taxes, which failed on a June 2012 ballot. To his credit, Brown did approve a 2013 law that reduced sales taxes on the purchase of manufacturing equipment, but this was just a marginal improvement to an otherwise messy tax code.</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s follies are not limited to tax policy. He, also, scores poorly on spending for substantially increasing the size of California&#8217;s budget. Over the last three years, Brown has proposed general fund spending increases averaging 6.8 percent annually, more than twice the national average over that period. California&#8217;s general fund spending has grown from $86 billion in 2012 to Brown&#8217;s proposed spending for 2015 of $107 billion. Brown recently called his 2015 budget one of “restraint and prudence,” a laughable claim. </p>
<p>Even worse, California has $340 billion in unfunded pension and health care liabilities to current and future state retirees and state debt, according to the state&#8217;s Legislative Analyst Office. These may represent even higher taxes in the future, unless California gets its spending under control.</p>
State fiscal decisions matter to the future of the American economy. Much attention is paid to the uncompetitiveness of the federal corporate income tax, which collected $274 billion in 2013. According to Ernst & Young, state and local taxes cost businesses $671 billion in 2013. The burden of state business taxation dwarfs the burden of the federal corporate tax.
<p>With the largest state-local tax burdens of any state and one of the worst business climates, many businesses are choosing to leave California for more economically friendly states like Texas.</p>
<p>California residents are also taking notice of the lower taxes elsewhere. Manhattan Institute research suggests that many Californians are leaving the state. Surely, many things affect migration, like weather, commutes, job opportunities, and families. California &mdash; unlike many other high-tax states &mdash; does have a fantastic climate and many geographic advantages, but higher taxes don&#8217;t encourage individuals to stay put.</p>
<p>Lower taxes and less government spending allows the economy to flourish. That means more jobs, more opportunities, and more freedom for individuals to pursue their passions. Governor Brown&#8217;s policies are moving California in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>When the government &ldquo;fines&rdquo; you for not buying health insurance, is it, in fact, a fine, a tax or government extortion? The biggest U.S. banks have been &ldquo;fined&rdquo; something in the neighborhood of $125 billion (yes, billion) over the past five years, without anyone in the banks or the banks themselves charged or convicted of criminal wrongdoing. How can that be?</p>
<p>Countless individuals have had their property (automobiles, cash and bank accounts) seized by state, local and federal law enforcement officials, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), without being convicted of wrongdoing. How can that be?</p>
<p>The distinction between a tax, a fine and government extortion is not trivial, particularly when fines are running into the tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for the government. Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution states: &ldquo;All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.&rdquo; The Fourth Amendment states: &ldquo;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,&rdquo; and that warrants can only be issued with probable cause. The Fifth Amendment in part states: &ldquo;No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.&rdquo; Unfortunately, these basic and clear provisions of the Constitution are violated on a daily basis by all too many ignorant or corrupt law enforcement officials, and upheld all too often by judges who think their own opinions trump the Constitution.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Americans must root out officials who contravene the Constitution to fleece taxpayers.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Obamacare case. Chief Justice John Roberts upheld the law by ruling that a &ldquo;fine&rdquo; for not buying health insurance, which would not be legal, was actually a &ldquo;tax,&rdquo; which was legal &mdash; even though the Obama administration and most members of Congress who voted for the bill denied they were voting for a tax. (A very short and amusing interview on this issue, with well-known constitutional scholar and Cato board chairman, Bob Levy, is available on the websites of <em>The Washington Times</em> and of the <a href="http://freedomandprosperity.org/2014/videos/hotnomics-commerce-clause/" target="_blank">Center for Freedom and Prosperity Foundation</a>.)</p>
<p>The government, merely by threatening to bring charges against banks and their officers, has been able to extort multibillion-dollar fines, because a charge of criminal wrongdoing against a bank could cause depositors to flee, undermining its viability. The Justice and Treasury departments have also engaged in this type of extortion against foreign banks, including destroying a 350-year old bank in Switzerland that had no offices in the United States and was not in violation of Swiss law. Justice and Treasury are able to get away with this type of extortion because a number of the bank regulations contradict each other. Thus, it is impossible for the banks to be in total compliance with all of the regulations, and they are sitting ducks for extortion by intellectually and politically corrupt government officials.</p>
<p>Asset-forfeiture laws were passed to make it easier to convict drug dealers, tax evaders and &ldquo;money launderers,&rdquo; but the idea has been expanded to now include more than 200 crimes. For many years, the IRS has been seizing bank accounts without bothering to get convictions for tax evasion. Some law enforcement officials have used the seized cash and property to fund their own operations, even though those whose property was taken were in many cases not convicted of any wrongdoing. This corruption has led the first two directors of the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Office (John Yoder and Brad Cates) to call for repeal of the asset forfeiture and anti-money laundering laws. The abuses have been so widespread that demands for reform are growing. Even The Washington Post has taken notice, publishing an article two weeks ago by Mr. Yoder and Mr. Cates in which they wrote: &ldquo;Civil asset forfeiture and money-laundering laws are gross perversions of the status of government amid a free citizenry. The individual is the font of sovereignty in our constitutional republic, and it is unacceptable that a citizen should have to &lsquo;prove&rsquo; anything to the government. If the government has probable cause of a violation of law, then let a warrant be issued. And if the government has proof beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt, let that guilt be proclaimed by 12 peers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The citizens of Hong Kong have been courageously standing up to the Chinese government for violations of their basic rights. Yet, too many Americans have become timid (unlike the American Founders, who were not wimps) in protecting our own rights against the abuses by the IRS, some law enforcement officials and irresponsible judges. It would be interesting to know where all of those who are now running for the House and Senate stand on asset forfeiture and other forms of government extortion &mdash; and what they intend to do about it.</p>

<p>Florida&rsquo;s school choice tax credit law benefits taxpayers and tens of thousands of low-income students. Both groups stand to lose if the state&rsquo;s largest teachers union wins its legal challenge.</p>
<p>In a Sept. 24 editorial, The Palm Beach Post cited the Florida Education Association&rsquo;s claims that the 13-year-old Florida Tax Credit Scholarship (FTCS) program is unconstitutional and &ldquo;take[s] money away from public schools.&rdquo; However, the plain meaning of the Florida Constitution gives ample constitutional space for the FTCS and the government&rsquo;s own accounting shows that the law saves money overall.</p>
<p>The FTCS grants tax credits in return for corporate donations to nonprofit scholarship organizations that help low-income families afford the school that best meets their children&rsquo;s educational needs. This year, nearly 70,000 students are receiving scholarships worth nearly $4,700, on average.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Tax credits are constitutionally no different than tax deductions for charitable contributions to religious organizations or property tax exemptions for houses of worship.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FEA&rsquo;s legal challenge rests on two provisions of the state constitution. The first mandates that the state provide a &ldquo;uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high-quality system of free public schools.&rdquo; The FEA interprets &ldquo;uniform&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;exclusive,&rdquo; barring the state from supporting any alternatives to that system. What the FEA fails to mention is that the end of that sentence explicitly authorizes the state to create &ldquo;other public education programs that the needs of the people may require.&rdquo; While the state Supreme Court has narrowly interpreted that clause in the past, a plain reading of the provision clearly authorizes such laws.</p>
<p>The second constitutional provision the FEA invokes forbids &ldquo;revenue of the state&rdquo; from being &ldquo;taken from the public treasury&rdquo; to aid &ldquo;any sectarian institution.&rdquo; However, no high court has ever accepted the FEA&rsquo;s legal argument.</p>
<p>In a case regarding a similar scholarship tax credit law in Arizona, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the tax credit funds were not public money because they had not &ldquo;come into the tax collector&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;[p]rivate bank accounts cannot be equated with the [&#8230;] State Treasury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that sense, tax credits are constitutionally no different than tax deductions for charitable contributions to religious organizations or property tax exemptions for houses of worship. In none of those cases are religious institutions funded by &ldquo;revenue of the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Arizona Supreme Court has also ruled that tax credits do not constitute public money. On the same day as the FEA announced its lawsuit, the New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected plaintiffs&rsquo; standing to challenge a scholarship tax credit law because they could not demonstrate that they were harmed by it. While the Florida Supreme Court is not bound to follow the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court or other states&rsquo; high courts, the same logic should apply.</p>
<p>If the state Supreme Court errs by adopting the FEA&rsquo;s faulty logic, tens of thousands of low-income students would lose access to the schools that work for them. Moreover, taxpayers would have to pick up the tab.</p>
<p>The scholarships are much smaller than the amount spent per pupil in the public schools, so the decrease in revenue from the tax credits is more than offset by the corresponding decrease in expenditures. Last year, scholarships averaged about $4,650, which is barely more than half of the statewide average of $10,162 per pupil in Florida&rsquo;s public schools, according to the most recent NCES data. The state&rsquo;s portion of that spending is nearly $7,000 per pupil, on average.</p>
<p>In a 2010 analysis, the Florida Legislature&rsquo;s nonpartisan Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability determined that the scholarship law saved the state $36.2 million in just a single year. The program decreased state revenues by $82.2 million while reducing expenditures by $118.4 million. That&rsquo;s $1.44 in savings for every $1 in reduced tax revenue. The FEA seeks to transform those savings into costs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that the Florida Supreme Court follows the plain meaning of the state constitution and the logic and precedent of every other high court to consider similar challenges.</p>

<p>On Oct. 1, a new round of foreign H-1B guest workers will begin to work in the United States. H-1B visas are for skilled workers in specialty occupations, mainly in engineering and computer occupations. H-1B visas are an important, albeit flawed, mechanism for highly skilled immigrants to enter the United States and contribute to our economy.</p>
<p>Only 85,000 H-1B visas are set aside for American firms to sponsor each year. The approval process begins on April 1 and the approved workers can begin working on Oct. 1. H-1B visas can be used for a total of six years before the worker either must return to his home country or earn a green card.</p>
<p>The economic benefits of H-1Bs and other highly skilled immigrants are large.</p>
<p>Highly skilled immigrants contribute mightily to innovation in the United States, especially through patents. In 2006, immigrants were roughly 12 percent of the U.S. population, but 24 percent of international patent applications from the United States had at least one non-citizen inventor. The real rate is even higher since those statistics don&#8217;t include immigrants who became U.S. citizens. Immigrants from China, Taiwan, India, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom were especially likely to patent.</p>
<p>Recent research by economists Jennifer Hunt and Marjolaine Gauthier-Loiselle found that a 1 percentage point increase in college graduate immigrants as a share of the population increases patents per capita by 9 to 18 percent &mdash; a tremendous increase. Other research found that a 10 percent increase in H-1B workers in a particular American city corresponded with a 0.3 to 0.7 percent increase in total patents approved there. Foreign-born students in American universities are also very likely to patent.</p>

<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">H-1B visas are an important, albeit flawed, mechanism for highly skilled immigrants to enter the United States and contribute to our economy.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some research finds that about 50 percent of U.S. productivity growth between 1950 and 1993 could be attributed to growth in the share of scientists and engineers &mdash; two sectors that are expanding largely due to highly skilled immigration.</p>
<p>Not all patents are productive, but a greater number of patents contribute to productivity gains for American workers. The more productive American workers become, the more their wages are likely to rise. A recent economics paper found that an increased number of immigrants working in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) occupations can explain between one-third and one-half of average productivity growth between 1990 and 2010. That translates into higher wages for almost all Americans.</p>
<p>Highly skilled immigrants are also very entrepreneurial. Between 1995 and 2005, 25.3 percent of all technology and engineering firms established in the United States had at least one immigrant founder or cofounder. Forty-six percent of those new firms specialized in innovation- and manufacturing-related services and 33 percent were software firms. Besides founding firms, many foreign-born workers were key employees in startups. Many successful firms that provide valuable services to American consumers would not have been possible without the contributions of these immigrant workers.</p>
<p>While those economic benefits accrue under the current restrictive immigration system, we would benefit far more with a few simple reforms.</p>
<p>First, the number of H-1B visas and green cards available for highly skilled workers should be uncapped or, at a minimum, increased dramatically. Market forces and legitimate security concerns should guide how many skilled immigrants come to our shores, not arbitrary government quotas or other expensive regulations.</p>
<p>Second, H-1B workers should be able to switch jobs just as easily as American citizens can. Currently, H-1Bs are sponsored by American companies and if the worker quits without finding a new job, he immediately becomes an illegal immigrant. That needs to change.</p>
<p>Third, there needs to be a visa for skilled entrepreneurs who intend to start a business in the United States. Oftentimes, foreign graduates of American universities who intend to start new firms are stopped by complex visa rules that prevent most workers from sponsoring themselves on a work visa. A simple visa for entrepreneurs would resolve much of these issues.</p>
<p>H-1B workers and other highly skilled immigrants add tremendous value to America&#8217;s economy. However, government regulations on these skilled immigrants limit their potential economic contributions. To increase these benefits, these visas should be reformed and liberalized.</p>

<p>The United States has been at war in Afghanistan for 13 years. That is as long as it was at war in the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II and the Korean War combined. The conflict reflects purposeless inertia in Washington. Keeping nearly 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan would just sustain the bloody status quo.</p>
<p>Then-President George W. Bush was right to oust the Taliban in 2001. Washington had to teach the unmistakable lesson that no government would remain in power if it hosted terrorists who attacked America. But then the Bush administration lost interest, preferring to use terrorism as an excuse to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein rather than use it as a reason to rebuild Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later the U.S. and its allies have built a large government bureaucracy and security force, but on foundations of sand. The Afghan government is noted for venality, incompetence and corruption; the military&rsquo;s performance is uneven at best. Indeed, despite high international expectations and intense outside pressure, Afghanistan could not even hold a fair and free election. The power-sharing agreement between President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and &ldquo;Chief Executive&rdquo; Abdullah Abdullah will require extraordinary statesmanship to succeed &mdash; a virtue never in high supply in Kabul.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">The U.S. has discovered time and again &mdash; in Iraq, the Balkans, Yemen, Somalia and Libya as well as in Afghanistan &mdash; that bombing, invading and occupying other nations rarely delivers stability.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet the administration wants to retain 9,800 Americans and roughly 2,000 to 3,000 Europeans in the middle of this mess. President Barack Obama proclaimed a &ldquo;historic day&rdquo; with the signing of the bilateral security agreement, reflective of “an enduring partnership that strengthens Afghan sovereignty, stability, unity and prosperity and that contributes to our shared goal of defeating al-Qaida and its extremist affiliates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s wrong on all counts. The influx of Western cash has created wealth for the elite but not genuine prosperity. Afghanistan&rsquo;s sovereignty will suffer as long as the government is dependent on foreign forces. Domestic unity has been a mirage for a long time.</p>
<p>Al-Qaida has been ejected from Afghanistan, which is why Osama bin Laden was located in Pakistan. With al-Qaida affiliates active in Pakistan, Syria and Yemen, Afghanistan no longer even counts as a minor front in the war on terrorism.</p>
<p>Finally, the continuing U.S. presence seems unlikely to lead to anything approaching stability. Even these diminished troop levels are to be cut in half by 2016 and reduced to a normal embassy contingent by the end of 2017. The Afghan tragedy goes back decades. Washington has devoted tens of thousands of troops, thousands of lives, tens of billions of dollars and scores of high-level diplomatic missions to fixing the country. Retaining a handful of troops &mdash; not enough to defend the government from the Taliban but too many to remain uninvolved &mdash; won&rsquo;t remedy the system&rsquo;s deep deficiencies.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Afghan people must decide how to live together. That isn&rsquo;t likely to result in a strong central government &mdash; especially one based on liberal, democratic Western ideals. However, what emerges won&rsquo;t be critical to the United States so long as Afghanistan does not host terrorists bent on striking the U.S. Of course, the ongoing conflict destabilizes Pakistan, but that has been the case for years. Indeed, the United States’ involvement results in frequent confrontations between Washington and Islamabad. A full U.S. withdrawal would reduce conflict. Some analysts fear that India, Iran and Russia might intervene absent a robust American presence. However, “the Great Game” inevitably will be played as Washington&rsquo;s force levels and interest drop.</p>
<p>Anyway, the most important question for Washington is stability for whom? American security is not dependent on Central Asian stability. No doubt, Washington desires to preserve an intelligence presence in Afghanistan. However, that does not require thousands of military personnel authorized, as under the new agreement, to engage in combat if &ldquo;mutually agreed.&rdquo; Naturally, the U.S. hopes to forestall a Taliban victory. But one is not preordained. Taliban brutality and misrule have cost the movement support; the end of foreign intervention would undercut its claims to self rule.</p>
<p>Other factions might prove more resilient than expected. After the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan their client, Mohammad Najibullah, survived more than three years against the mujahedeen. The U.S. should give up trying to impose stability. The U.S. has discovered time and again &mdash; in Iraq, the Balkans, Yemen, Somalia and Libya as well as in Afghanistan &mdash; that bombing, invading and occupying other nations rarely delivers stability. Instead, intervention results in new forms of instability.</p>
<p>Two years ago Vice President Joe Biden stated, &ldquo;We are leaving. We are leaving in 2014. Period.&rdquo; Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s another promise the administration intends to break. Never mind the new government in Kabul. U.S. troops should leave Afghanistan. Period. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most dangerous myth to come out of financial crisis is that if we had just rescued Lehman Brothers everything would have been fine. Behind this myth is the Dodd-Frank (empty) promise of more regulatory tools.</p>
<p>Further embedding the regulatory bias toward bailouts is worse. Obsessions over Lehman have distracted us from correcting the actual imbalances in our system that caused the crisis. Letting Lehman fail was the right choice. The problem was not applying this to other insolvent firms.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the <em>New York Times</em> ran a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/business/revisiting-the-lehman-brothers-bailout-that-never-was.html?_r=0" target="_blank">story</a> claiming that insiders at the New York Federal Reserve had actually concluded that the Fed did have the authority to rescue Lehman. The implication of the story seems to be that not doing so was a tragic mistake.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Saving Lehman would have been just one of many actions of questionable legality taken by regulators.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These &ldquo;revelations&rdquo; really aren&rsquo;t all that surprising or even relevant. Depending on the day of the week and who you ask, one gets a variety of explanations for why Lehman was not rescued; lack of legal authority, lack of liquidity assets, and so on. Since when did regulators let a lack of legal authority stop them? There was zero legal authority for the FDIC&rsquo;s broad guarantee of bank holding debt. That didn&rsquo;t seem to matter. Thanks to some enterprising reporters at <em>Bloomberg</em>, who dared to sue the Fed, we now know the Fed lends against all sorts of shoddy assets, including equity. So let&rsquo;s get one thing clear: saving Lehman would have been just one of many actions of questionable legality taken by regulators. Hank Paulson admits as much in his crisis memoirs, <em>On The Brink.</em></p>
<p>Let us first recall that by the time of Lehman&rsquo;s failure we were already in a recession. The American economy had already lost almost 2 million jobs the cycle before Lehman&rsquo;s failure. The overwhelming majority of the decline in real consumer spending occurred before Lehman&rsquo;s failure. In all likelihood most of the job losses after Lehman were due to declines in real consumer spending that preceded Lehman&rsquo;s failure. Unless Lehman&rsquo;s failure created some Star Trek-style backward ripple in time, the temporal order is quite clear: we were already in a deep recession by the time of Lehman&rsquo;s failure. Saving Lehman would not have changed that.</p>
<p>Contra conventional wisdom, the Lehman bankruptcy was not all that disorderly. Most of Lehman&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2013-09-11/lehman-brothers-barclays-nomura-tale-of-two-takeovers?ea9c8a2de0ee111045601ab04d673622" target="_blank">operations</a> changed hands within weeks. Barclays quickly acquired Lehman&rsquo;s American operations, while Nomura purchased Lehman&rsquo;s European, Middle Eastern and African operations. While countless transactions are still being resolved within Lehman&rsquo;s bankruptcy proceedings, the fact is that the bulk of Lehman cleanly and quickly changed hands in an orderly manner. Compared to the resolutions of AIG, Fannie Mae or the auto companies, which all received billions of taxpayer dollars, the Lehman resolution was a smashing success.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy of Lehman also allowed its assets to transfer in a more efficient manner than the shotgun marriages arranged by the Fed. JP Morgan Chase has recently paid billions in fines and compliance costs due to its assisted purchase of Bear Stearns. Bank of America was for some time paralyzed by its acquisition of Countrywide, spending billions on litigation, compliance and mitigation of Countrywide’s legacy mortgage portfolio. Those deals might have looked smart at the time, but they hobbled their acquirers in a manner that reduced lending relative to purchasing such assets out of bankruptcy. Typical of financial crisis responses, they placed short-term appearances before long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>Lehman&rsquo;s failure also served as the rationale for a massive expansion of federal power under Dodd-Frank. By claiming that regulators &ldquo;lack the tools&rdquo; both Congress and the regulators could ignore their own failings and find solace in expanding the power of regulators to &ldquo;resolve&rdquo; nonbanks. But even when regulators had the power to resolve nonbanks at no cost to the taxpayers, as with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, regulators choose not to use those tools. There&rsquo;s no reason we should expect regulators to behave any differently in the future.</p>
<p>Ultimately the responses to the financial crisis were not about avoiding losses but deciding who would bear them. In too many cases the decision was made to have the taxpayer bear those losses (or other members of the financial industry). Lehman&rsquo;s failure was a last minute attempt to insert market discipline and allow losses to be borne by private parties. This changed the market expectations created by Bear&rsquo;s rescue. We know that Lehman leadership repeatedly refused offers to be purchased, unwilling to accept any offers below $10 per share because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what Bear got.&rdquo; Had the correct decision been made on Bear, Lehman would likely have been purchased and its failure averted. Even so, we have no hope of avoiding future crises unless we bring market discipline back to our financial markets. Allowing Lehman to fail was the right choice. The mistake was not applying that choice to other insolvent companies.</p>

<p>Gov. Deval Patrick&rsquo;s tax-and-spend approach to governance is dragging down Massachusetts&rsquo; economic recovery and scaring off new and dynamic businesses to other parts of the country.</p>
<p>The Great Recession ended in 2009, but its effects are still being felt within state budgets. To close the gap between higher spending and lower-than-expected government revenues, governors took varying approaches. Some, like North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, cut spending and cut taxes to breathe new life into their economies. Patrick, on the other hand, hampered Massachusetts&rsquo; competitiveness by raising taxes and expanding the government even faster.</p>
<p>The Cato Institute&rsquo;s 12th biennial edition of its &ldquo;Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&rsquo;s Governors&rdquo; assigns grades of &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;F&rdquo; to the governors based on their efforts to restrain government. Patrick received an &ldquo;F&rdquo; in this report card, down from a &ldquo;C&rdquo; in 2012.</p>
<p>What sparked the large drop in Patrick&rsquo;s rating? His desire to dramatically increase taxes on Massachusetts families and businesses.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Deval Patrick&#8217;s policies have been moving Massachusetts in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the time he took office in 2007, Patrick has shown a penchant for higher levels of revenue, but in 2012, he hiked taxes considerably. Every year, he has called for more and more in tax revenue. In 2012 he proposed sales taxes on candy and soda, and higher taxes on cigarettes, and corporations.</p>
<p>In 2013 he signed into law numerous tax increases. He raised taxes on corporations and utilities. The cigarette tax was increased by $1 per pack. He increased the gasoline tax by 3 cents per gallon (henceforth to be indexed to inflation unless voters repeal that provision in November). He also expanded the sales tax to include software purchases, intensifying the tax burden unnecessarily on businesses in the commonwealth. Fortunately, this tax increase was repealed by the Legislature this year.</p>
<p>Also in 2013, he proposed an income tax increase, which would have raised the rate from 5.25 percent to 6.25 percent causing individuals and families to cough up more of their hard-earned dollars to government. The plan would have reduced the sales tax, which is a positive step, but overall would have increased the tax burden by $1.9 billion overall.</p>
<p>Massachusetts already had one of the highest state-local tax burdens in the country. Patrick&rsquo;s plan would have pushed the envelope even further.</p>
<p>Luckily for Massachusetts taxpayers, the income tax hike did not pass. But that didn&rsquo;t stop Patrick from proposing higher taxes <em>again</em>. In 2014, for the third year in a row, Patrick called for sales taxes on candy and soda.</p>
<p>These decisions matter. Much attention is paid to the federal corporate income tax which collected $274 billion in 2013. According to Ernst & Young, state and local taxes cost businesses $671 billion in 2013. The burden of state business taxation dwarfs federal taxation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Massachusetts is subject to ever-growing interstate and international competition. Massachusetts consistently ranks 47th for best state in which to do business. Its business tax climate is in the bottom half of states. It also has strong tax competition from its regional peers. Scaring away small businesses and entrepreneurs with onerous tax and regulatory systems is no way to boost the economy.</p>
<p>Residents are also taking notice. A poll earlier this year found that 40 percent of Massachusetts residents want to leave the state. Surely, many things affect migration, like weather, commuting times, job opportunities, and families, but the combination of higher taxes and cold winters doesn&rsquo;t encourage individuals to stay in the state.</p>
<p>Lower taxes and less government spending allows the economy to flourish. That means more jobs, more opportunities, and more freedom for individuals to pursue their passions. Patrick&rsquo;s policies have been moving Massachusetts in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>America&rsquo;s high business taxes are discouraging investment and prompting companies to move their headquarters abroad. Most policymakers say they favor cutting the corporate-tax rate to help fix the problem, but reforms are stuck in Washington gridlock.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for the states. Many governors are championing fiscal reforms, and business tax cuts are one area of progress. We document these reforms in Cato&rsquo;s new &ldquo;fiscal report card,&rdquo; which assigns grades of &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;F&rdquo; to the governors based on their efforts to restrain government since 2012.</p>
<p>This year we awarded &ldquo;A&rdquo; grades to four governors:</p>
<ul>
<li> Pat McCrory of North Carolina signed a bill replacing individual-income-tax rates of 6.0, 7.0, and 7.75 percent with a single rate of 5.75 percent. He also cut the corporate-tax rate from 6.9 to 5.0 percent and repealed the estate tax.</li>
<li>Sam Brownback of Kansas approved a plan in 2012 replacing three individual-income-tax rates with two and cutting the top rate from 6.45 to 4.9 percent. The reform also increased the standard deduction and reduced taxes on small businesses. Brownback cut income-tax rates further in 2013.</li>
<li>Paul LePage of Maine signed major income-tax cuts in 2011, and he is pushing for further tax reforms. State spending has been roughly flat in recent years, and LePage has trimmed spending on welfare, health care, and other programs.</li>
<li>Mike Pence of Indiana has been frugal on spending and a champion tax cutter. He signed bills to cut individual-income-tax rates 5 percent (the current rate of 3.4 percent will fall to 3.23 percent in 2017) and repeal the inheritance tax. He also approved a corporate-income-tax rate cut and a major reduction in property taxes on businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;A&rdquo; governors were Republicans. Over the years, the data-driven Cato report cards have shown that Republican governors are more fiscally conservative, on average, than Democrats. This year is no exception, which is illustrated by the fact that all eight governors earning an &ldquo;F&rdquo; were Democrats.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are some Democratic centrists making reforms, including Andrew Cuomo of New York and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, who both earned a &ldquo;B.&rdquo; Cuomo cut corporate-income-tax rates, simplified the corporate tax base, increased the estate-tax exemption, and cut property taxes on manufacturers. Chafee cut the corporate-tax rate by two percentage points, repealed the franchise tax, and reduced the estate tax.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Washington is gridlocked, but many states are cutting taxes.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Republicans were behind nearly all of the major tax cuts of recent years. John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin cut individual-income-tax rates across the board. Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota cut individual and corporate tax rates. Rick Snyder of Michigan and Susana Martinez of New Mexico spearheaded major business tax cuts.</p>
<p>The current focus on business tax cuts is encouraging. According to Ernst & Young, state and local taxes cost businesses $671 billion in 2013, which was more than twice the $274 billion burden of the federal corporate income tax that year. The largest state taxes on businesses are property taxes ($242 billion) and sales taxes on business inputs ($140 billion).</p>
<p>State and local taxes harm America&rsquo;s competitiveness. One reason why Mexico, for example, is a good place to build a factory is that it has very low property taxes. By contrast, most U.S. states impose property taxes not only on land and buildings, but also on business equipment such as machinery and computers. So kudos to the governors who are making reforms &mdash; Pence of Indiana and Snyder of Michigan, for example, approved a repeal of these damaging equipment taxes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all good news in the states. Jerry Brown of California and Pat Quinn of Illinois, for example, earned &ldquo;F&rdquo; grades for their large tax hikes. But looking across all the states, we are in the midst of the best tax-cutting run since the late 1990s.</p>
<p>As for the federal corporate-income tax, we may have to wait until one of our tax-cutting governors arrives in the White House.</p>

<p>The British government recently launched an independent review of the sharing economy in order to assess its “social and economic potential.” Although this approach to the sharing economy is in stark contrast to what is often seen on the other side of the Atlantic, sharing economy fans should be wary of what the review may recommend.</p>
<p>The website for the review (published on Monday) does not currently contain many details, however it does mention that three sectors where the sharing economy is firmly established in the U.K. will be examined. These three sectors are 1) “personal and commercial space,” 2) “transport,” and 3) time and skills.”</p>
<p>The “personal and commercial space” sector includes companies such as Airbnb and One Fine Stay, online marketplaces where homeowners can advertise their properties for short-term rents. Thanks to laws enacted during the 1970s, homeowners in London who want to rent their homes for less than three months must have permission from local LOCM -2.44% authorities to do so. However, in June Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said, “It&#8217;s time to change the outdated, impractical and restrictive laws from the 1970s, open up London&#8217;s homes to visitors and allow Londoners to make some extra cash.” Changes in the laws are included in the Deregulation Bill, which is currently at the committee stage in the House of Lords.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">It should not come as a surprise if the British government’s independent review recommends policies which allow for the sharing economy to function in a potentially problematic regulatory framework.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “transport” sector of the sharing economy in the U.K. includes Uber, which is competing with London&#8217;s iconic black cabs. London cabbies held a protest earlier this year against how Uber was being treated by London&#8217;s transportation regulator; a move that Uber claimed resulted in an explosion in British signups. London mayor and self described fan of rules-based anarchy Boris Johnson said shortly after the London cabbie protests that banning Uber in the U.K.’s capital would be difficult. Lyft, one of Uber&#8217;s main U.S. competitors, has yet to launch in the U.K., but a British entrepreneur could develop an app to compete with Uber&#8217;s technology. GetTaxi, an app that allows users to hail a licensed black cab, is already providing Uber with some competition.</p>
<p>The last firmly established sector of the sharing economy that will be subject to the British government&#8217;s review is “time and skills.” One of the most prominent sharing economy companies in this sector is TaskRabbit, a U.S.-based company that launched in London last November. The company allows for users to outsource a range of tasks such as furniture assembly, keg delivery, house cleaning, and lawn mowing. TaskRabbit competes in the U.K. with Sooqini and TaskPandas, two other errand marketplaces.</p>
<p>London, and the U.K. more broadly, could be an ideal incubator for the sharing economy. The U.K. is a wealthy country and home to one of the world&#8217;s largest financial centers as well as a large population of Internet-connected adults. Given the right legal and regulatory environment, there is no reason why the U.K. could not compete with California as the world&#8217;s center of technological entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Yet the review could make policy recommendations that would hamper the growth of the sharing economy in the U.K. According to the review&#8217;s website, the methodology of the review includes seeking evidence from “established businesses that are facing increased competition from the sharing economy.” The review will also ask established businesses for their opinions on policies and regulations.</p>
<p>If the review considers the opinions of established businesses that are threatened by the rise of the sharing economy, there is a risk that the review will recommend uncompetitive and burdensome policies that may let sharing economy companies operate, albeit in awkward regulatory environments.</p>
<p>In the case of the transport sector, the review may recommend that special regulatory carve outs for companies such as Uber be created. Such regulatory schemes can be seen in California, where regulators have labeled ridesharing companies as Transportation Network Companies. While such a designation does allow ridesharing companies to operate legally, it adds to the number of regulations already affecting the transportation industry and could become problematic if a company like Uber expands from being solely a transportation technology company to a company that is also involved in logistics.</p>
<p>Likewise, errand marketplaces like TaskRabbit could develop into marketplaces where users not only seek handymen but also teachers for their children or doctors to make house calls, a service already offered by the American app Pager. Such developments would be difficult if a special regulatory designation is created for errand markets in their current form.</p>
<p>Supporters of the sharing economy may be reassured that the review is being lead by Debbie Wosskow, who runs the sharing economy network Collaborative Consumption Europe and is CEO of Love Home Swap, a vacation home-swapping company. However, established businesses will be sure to make their grievances heard, and given that Wosskow is tasked with exploring the “risks” the sharing economy may pose to the U.K. it should not come as a surprise if the British government&#8217;s independent review recommends policies which allow for the sharing economy to function in a potentially problematic regulatory framework.</p>

<p>Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution says that &ldquo;No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.&rdquo; Aside from declaring war &mdash; something Congress never bothers with any more &mdash; few responsibilities are more basic or important for our national legislature.</p>
<p>And, under the rules of the House of Representatives, those appropriations (with certain exceptions) are supposed to be passed in one of twelve appropriations bills. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires Congress to act on appropriation bills by June 30 of each year, although there is no enforcement mechanism if that deadline is missed. More realistically, then, Congress is supposed to act before the start of the new fiscal year, October 1.</p>
<p>Yet Congress has not passed all twelve appropriation bills since 1994. This year, in fact, Congress passed exactly <em>none</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Congress keeps ignoring its proper budgetary responsibilities.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not exactly shocking. Congress didn&rsquo;t pass any last year either. It makes one wonder what exactly we are paying them for.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s not entirely fair. The House did manage to pass 7 of the 12 appropriation bills, just nudging itself over .500. On the other hand, the Senate, under the dynamic leadership of Harry Reid, failed to bring even one to the floor for a vote.</p>
<p>Therefore, this September, Congress again resorted to funding the government through a continuing resolution, a catch-all bill, that will fund the government through December 11, when a lame-duck Congress can come back and &#8230; pass another continuing resolution.</p>
<p>Although generally touted as maintaining 2015 spending at 2014 levels, the bill actually includes increased &ldquo;authorization&rdquo; for spending on disaster relief, &ldquo;overseas contingency operations&rdquo; (read: war), and other areas, without corresponding offsets. While exact spending on these items won&rsquo;t be known for some time, it is likely that final spending in 2015 will exceed 2014 levels. The increase in OCO spending, while understandable, is particularly problematic since it is not subject to normal budget rules. In the past, Congress has treated OCO money as something of a slush fund.</p>
<p>Use of a continuing resolution did serve one useful function as far as Congress is concerned. It protected members from having to vote on contentious issues shortly before an election. Thus, the CR continues funding for the Export-Import Bank until June 30, 2015. Needless to say, Obamacare funding also continues. The CR also failed to extend a moratorium on internet bandwidth or e-mail taxes past December.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the CR authorizes the president to arm the Syrian rebels. Thus Congress managed to duck its responsibilities for both war and spending in a single bill. <em>That</em> is efficiency.</p>
<p>The CR is also notable for what it did not do. It did not reform the entitlement programs that threaten to bankrupt this country in the future. It did not reduce corporate welfare. It did not eliminate wasteful or failed programs. It simply rubber-stamped the status quo that has brought us a $17.8 trillion national debt.</p>
<p>No wonder that Senator Tom Coburn (R., Okla.) called the CR &ldquo;a betrayal&rdquo; of taxpayers.</p>
<p>But for legislators of both parties, not rocking the boat before an election is exactly what they wanted. The CR passed 319&ndash;108 in the House. Just 53 House Republicans voted against it. In the Senate, the vote in favor was 78&ndash;22, with a majority of Republicans voting in favor.</p>
<p>For those looking toward 2016, both Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz voted &ldquo;no,&rdquo; while Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Paul Ryan voted &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conservatives rightly criticize President Obama for avoiding his responsibilities and ducking the hard choices. But Congress, including most congressional Republicans, may not have a lot of room to talk.</p>

<p>I am an atheist, but have never wavered in my conviction that persons with religious beliefs are entitled to the same freedom of choice as me. And in my vocation as a reporter, the person who has most influenced me was the late Frances Sweeney, a deeply religious Catholic editor of a penetratingly independent Boston newspaper where I first became a journalist in my teens.</p>

<p>Boston was then the most anti-Semitic city in the country, and in the Jewish ghetto where I grew up, boys knew if they walked alone down those streets at night, they could lose teeth from invading avengers of Christ&#8217;s death. I even lost some teeth.</p>

<p>Yet Frances Sweeney, in her newspaper and in public meetings, persistently criticized the city&#8217;s Catholic leadership for its continued silence on this bigotry. Threatened once with excommunication by Cardinal William O&#8217;Connell for her attacks, she nonetheless persisted in her criticism.</p>

<p>I was one of those teenage reporters who exposed some of the financiers of that anti-Semitism in her newspaper.</p>

<p>So I now have no hesitation, though still an atheist, in being drawn to a Catholic Church that, according to Pope Francis, “is poor and for the poor.”</p>

<p>In his first Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Evangelii Gaudium</em> (The Joy of the Gospel), presented last November, Pope Francis wrote: “Our faith in Christ, who became poor, and was always close to the poor and the outcast, is the basis of our concern for the integral development of society&#8217;s most neglected members &#8230;</p>

<p>“It means working to eliminate the structural causes of poverty and to promote the integral development of the poor, as well as small daily acts of solidarity in meeting the real needs which we encounter.”</p>

<p>Then, a Pope Francis advance: “It presumes the creation of a new mindset which thinks in terms of community and the priority of the life of all over the appropriation of goods by a few &#8230; This means education, access to health care, and above all, employment, for it is through free, creative, participatory and mutually supportive labour that human beings express and enhance the dignity of their lives.”</p>

<p>And dig this: “A just wage enables them to have adequate access to all the other goods which are destined for our common use.”</p>

<p>Lest you think Pope Francis was focusing solely on secular changes, he emphasized: “For the Church, the option for the poor is primarily a theological category rather than a cultural, sociological, political or philosophical one.</p>

<p>“God shows the poor ‘his first mercy.’ This divine preference has consequences for the faith life of all Christians, since we are called to have ‘this mind &#8230; which was in Jesus Christ’ &#8230;</p>

<p>“Inspired by this, the Church has made an option for the poor which is understood as a ‘special form of primacy in the exercise of Christian charity, to which the whole tradition of the Church bears witness’ &#8230;</p>

<p>“This is why I want a Church which is poor and for the poor. They have much to teach us. Not only do they share in the sensus fidei (sense of the faith), but in their difficulties they know the suffering Christ. We need to let ourselves be evangelized by them.”</p>

<p>Then, a challenge administered by Pope Francis. How many of you &mdash; of all backgrounds &mdash; agree with this?</p>

<p>Said Francis: “Growth in justice requires more than economic growth, while presupposing such growth: it requires decisions, programmes, mechanisms and processes specifically geared to a better distribution of income, the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality &#8230;</p>

<p>“Let us not leave in our wake a swath of destruction and death which will affect our own lives and those of future generations.”</p>

<p>To further illuminate some of Pope Francis’ global war on poverty, here are some facts about poverty in the United States:</p>

<p>“In 2013, the official poverty rate was 14.5 percent &#8230; There were 45.3 million people in poverty” (census.gov).</p>

<p>“More than 16 million children in the United States &mdash; 22 percent of all children &mdash; live in families with incomes below the federal poverty level &mdash; $23,550 a year for a family of four. Research shows that, on average, families need an income of about twice that level to cover basic expenses. Using this standard, 45 percent of children live in low-income families.</p>

<p>“Most of these children have parents who work, but low wages and unstable employment leave their families struggling to make ends meet” (National Center for Children in Poverty, nccp.org).</p>

<p>And, as if you didn&#8217;t know: “Poverty can impede children&#8217;s ability to learn and contribute to social, emotional and behavior problems.</p>

<p>“Poverty also can contribute to poor health and mental health. Risks are greatest for children who experience poverty when they are young and/or experience deep and persistent poverty.</p>

<p>“Research is clear that poverty is the single greatest threat to children&#8217;s well-being. But effective public policies &mdash; to make work pay for low-income parents and to provide high-quality early care and learning experiences for their children &mdash; can make a difference. Investments in the most vulnerable children are also critical” (nccp.org).</p>

<p>During this year&#8217;s midterm elections, and, of course, the all-encompassing 2016 elections, look and see how many candidates have anything specific and meaningful to propose about our poverty across the board.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also be interested in how many refer to Pope Francis on this crucial subject. One doesn&#8217;t have to be Catholic to bring this pope into such a vital conversation about our future.</p>

Ikenson</p>


<p>The charter of the U.S. Export-Import Bank was set to expire on September 30, <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/10/house-includes-short-term-ex-im-extension-in-government-funding-bill/" target="_blank">but received a nine-month extension, courtesy of provisions inserted into the Continuing Appropriations Resolution.</a> It remains to be seen whether Ex-Im is finally terminated on June 30, 2015, which is an outcome that may depend on greater awareness of the collateral damage the Bank inflicts on unwitting victims.</p>
<p>Through loans to foreign buyers and loan guarantees to banks, Ex-Im provides financing for U.S. export sales that private lenders allegedly are unwilling to offer. According to supporters, Ex-Im facilitates exports and creates jobs without costing taxpayers a dime &mdash; America wins, fist bump, end of story.</p>
<p>In reality, however, there are at least three sets of costs associated with every Ex-Im transaction, which are ignored or downplayed in the propagandized telling of Ex-Im&rsquo;s greatness.</p>
<p>First, the &ldquo;Opportunity Cost&rdquo; is the value-added activity which would have occurred, had Ex-Im&rsquo;s resources been deployed optimally &mdash; or, at least, more efficiently in the private sector. Second, the &ldquo;Intra-Industry Cost&rdquo; is the relative cost disadvantage experienced by domestic competitors &mdash; the unsubsidized U.S. firms in the same industry as a firm receiving Ex-Im subsidies. Third, the &ldquo;Downstream Industry Cost&rdquo; is the relative cost disadvantage imposed on the U.S. competitors of the subsidized foreign customer.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Policymakers should be wary of claims of Ex-Im&#8217;s costless benefits.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much like how an import tariff on sugar benefits some domestic beet and cane processors while harming confectioneries, beverage manufacturers, and other sugar-using producers, an Ex-Im-financed transaction benefits the exporter in question, while harming U.S. firms that consuming the export in question &mdash; even more so if the foreign customer is a direct competitor.</p>
<p>Using Export-Import Bank transaction data and input-output tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Cato Institute worked to estimate the downstream costs for each of 236 U.S. manufacturing sub-industries. The &ldquo;net benefits&rdquo; of Ex-Im were then calculated as the aggregated export finance subsidies received by each industry minus the downstream costs imposed on each industry.</p>
<p>The results indicate that, out of $50 billion in Ex-Im subsidies granted to non-aircraft U.S. manufacturers between 2007 and 2013, $40 billion shows up downstream, as costs imposed on other businesses. </p>
<p>The average company, in four out of every five manufacturing industries, incurs negative net benefits, meaning it is a &ldquo;victim&rdquo; of the Export-Import Bank. 189 out of 236 manufacturing sub-industries &mdash; <a href="http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/" target="_blank">as defined by the 6-digit specification of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which encompasses 21 broad manufacturing industries</a> — incurred costs in excess of benefits, to the tune of an aggregate $2.8 billion per year.</p>
<p>The five broad industries incurring the greatest net ExIm-related costs are producers of electrical equipment, appliances and components; furniture; food; non-metallic mineral products; and chemicals.</p>
<p>Manufacturing firms in every U.S. state can also be counted among Ex-Im&rsquo;s victims. The most important or second most important manufacturing industries in 47 states &mdash; in terms of added value to the economy &mdash; are among Ex-Im&rsquo;s ten largest victims. Of those 47 states, Ex-Im has the most significant negative impact on North Carolina, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Maryland.</p>
<p>However, not all industries are Ex-Im victims. 47 out of 236 sub-industries, across 13 of 21 industry categories can be counted as Ex-Im&rsquo;s &ldquo;winners,&rdquo; realizing $4.2 billion in annual net benefits. Viewed holistically, Ex-Im policies represent a net annual tax liability of $2.8 billion per year levied against 189 sub-industries, or $15 million per industry, and a net wealth transfer of $4.2 billion per year to 47 specific sub-industries. One would be hard-pressed to find a better example of a policy that &ldquo;picks winners and losers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Policymakers should be wary of claims of Ex-Im&rsquo;s costless benefits. They should know that the Bank&rsquo;s policies reward a few companies while hurting many more. Appreciating the hidden costs is essential to any informed judgments about the future of the Export-Import Bank.</p>

<p>With Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington for meetings with President Barack Obama, many observers are asking how his visit &mdash; and his diplomatic priorities more generally &mdash; will bear on the simmering competition between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>Modi has been on a diplomatic tear since he was took office in May, meeting with the leaders of Japan, China and now the United States. His visit and personal leadership style almost certainly will not alter the course of U.S.-Indian relations or India&#8217;s role in U.S. policy toward China. It is not the leadership or any individual but underlying factors that make India likely to play an important role in the U.S.-Chinese relationship. The longstanding belief in the U.S. foreign policy establishment that India, as a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), was on the other side of the Cold War started to fade in the late 1990s. India&#8217;s interest in the NAM &mdash; and to a lesser extent in the Soviet Union &mdash; was more about countering China than endorsing Soviet communism.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Despite commentators’ tendency to examine what impact Modi&#8217;s diplomacy might have on India&#8217;s role in U.S.-China relations, it may be his economic success or failure that bears more heavily on the future of the region.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, India remains the most confounding sort of state to U.S. leaders &mdash; a country that likes the United States and seeks friendly relations with it but does not portray itself as a junior partner in Washington&#8217;s various adventures around the world. Rather, India cooperates or disagrees with the U.S. where its interests overlap or diverge. For example, New Delhi has dragged its feet on sanctioning and limiting trade with Iran over its nuclear program and has sent no signal of substance on the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). However, India will likely continue to play a supporting role on another issue that is very important to Washington: the U.S.-led encirclement of China. This has little to do with Modi&#8217;s ideology and much to do with India&#8217;s geography and great-power politics. The disputed territory between China and India means New Delhi cannot help supporting this policy.</p>
<p>While Washington&#8217;s primary concern is with Chinese naval modernization, India plays a supporting role by complicating Chinese defense planning. As India focuses on defending itself against potential military threats on land, it creates trade-offs in Beijing between naval and land forces, pushing China to devote more defense planning and money to both land and sea power. During his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Modi <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-09-20/news/54135343_1_aksai-chin-india-and-china-india-visit" target="_blank">called for settling the border dispute</a>, but there has been no discernable progress toward that goal. For its part, China has created more than enough headaches for itself in the South and East China seas and seems unlikely to be spoiling for a flare-up in Arunachal Pradesh or Ladakh.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s comparative demographic situation, another underlying factor that makes India useful to U.S. interests in East Asia, has nothing to do with Modi either. While China possesses a demographic problem &mdash; the question whether it can grow rich before it grows old &mdash; India&#8217;s demographic profile is much younger, which should allow it more room to maneuver in its policy choices. It is also more balanced by gender. In 2040, roughly 68 percent of India&#8217;s population will be made up of working-age men and women, an increase of over 300 million from today.</p>
<p>This means that the gap between India and China in terms of working-age populations will be roughly 400 million in India&#8217;s favor by 2040. By 2030, there will be roughly 100 million young men with at least a high school education in India, compared with 75 million in China. The effect of these demographic realities on economic growth and national power should enable India to play a greater role in the region&#8217;s security.</p>
<p>These factors could conspire to push India toward becoming a reliable U.S. partner, but the fact that Modi has sought to foster fruitful relations with China as well as U.S. allies in the region, combined with his background, suggest that he is unlikely to fall into that role. Modi is a Hindu nationalist, so much so that he was the only person barred from entering the United States because of a U.S. law penalizing foreign leaders who fail to protect the rights of their religious minorities. (In 2002, during his tenure as governor of Gujarat state, he <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303380004579520041301275638" target="_blank">failed to stop riots and mob violence</a> between Hindus and Muslims; more than 1,000 people were killed, most of them Muslim.)</p>
<p>Beyond burnishing his nationalist credentials, Modi&rsquo;s priorities during his diplomatic junkets appear to be somewhat more basic: stabilizing India&rsquo;s shaky economic development. Although he made headlines with a statement during his visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe referring obliquely to Chinese &ldquo;<a href="http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/in-japan-pm-modi-hints-at-china-as-he-deplores-expansionist-tendencies_1463334.html" target="_blank">expansionism</a>,&rdquo; the emphasis of his travels appears to center on strengthening Indian economic growth. Wildly divergent economic policies among India&rsquo;s provinces have produced, unsurprisingly, markedly divergent economic results. For example, Modi&rsquo;s Gujarat ranked <a href="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/economic-freedom-india-2013/economic-freedom-states-of-india-executive-summary.pdf">first in a recent ranking of economic freedom in India</a>. Even his recent meeting with Xi focused not on security issues but on <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-29249268" target="_blank">deals</a> to cooperate in Indian rail modernization and to set up a number of cooperative industrial parks and allow increased penetration of Indian goods and services in China.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s &ldquo;success as a powerful democracy would help to transform the greater South Asian region while serving as an objective constraint on growing Chinese power,&rdquo; Ashley Tellis, a former U.S. India policy official, said <a href="http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/09/22/kick-starting-u.s.-indian-strategic-partnership/hpoa" target="_blank">recently</a>, commenting on the United States&rsquo; interest in India&rsquo;s economic growth. Interestingly, Japan and China support India&rsquo;s growth as well. Despite commentators&rsquo; tendency to examine what impact Modi&rsquo;s diplomacy might have on India&rsquo;s role in U.S.-China relations, it may be his economic success or failure that bears more heavily on the future of the region.</p>

<p>In light of my two lists of President Obama&rsquo;s top 10 constitutional violations &mdash; for <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2011/12/04/president-obamas-top-10-constitutional-violations/" target="_blank">2011</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ilyashapiro/2014/01/13/president-obamas-top-10-constitutional-violations-of-2013/" target="_blank">2013</a> – a few readers have asked me to follow up on my <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/eric-holders-tenure" target="_blank">short statement</a> about Attorney General Eric Holder&rsquo;s tenure by putting together a list for him. I had started thinking about that, but then came across <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2014/09/25/eric-holders-seven-worst-actions/" target="_blank">this item</a> by Hans von Spakovsky (who co-authored with John Fund <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Obamas-Enforcer-Holders-Justice-Department/dp/0062320920" target="_blank">a book</a> on Holder&rsquo;s missteps), which details Holder&rsquo;s &ldquo;7 Worst Actions as Attorney General.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Holder is the worst person to hold the position of attorney general since the disgraced John Mitchell.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operation Fast and Furious, for which the House of Representatives held him in contempt.</li>
<li>Holder&rsquo;s war on election integrity and how he &ldquo;racialized and radicalized&rdquo; the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division.</li>
<li>Failing to investigate the IRS&rsquo;s political targeting and enforce the House&rsquo;s contempt citation against Lois Lerner.</li>
<li>Handling national security threats as criminal justice issues and going after journalists in leak investigations while turning a blind eye on sensitive administration leaks.</li>
<li>Failing to advise President Obama against unconstitutional actions, refusing to enforce/defend federal laws.</li>
<li>Engaging in collusive lawsuits with advocacy groups to implement regulations without going through the normal legislative or even administrative course.</li>
<li>Treating Congress with contempt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I would break out a few of these. For example, Holder&rsquo;s election-related lawsuits are a bit of a different animal than his staffing of the Justice Department along racial/partisan lines (both listed at number 2), even they&rsquo;re symbiotically related. And the issue of how Holder handled national security matters is different from his surveillance of journalists (number 4). Most importantly, the unconstitutional executive actions are so numerous, they surely shouldn&rsquo;t all be bunched together (number 5).</p>
<p>I would also add a few obvious items, which I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/eric-holders-tenure" target="_blank">previous statement</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lawsuits against school choice in Louisiana and Wisconsin, invoking civil rights laws to prevent poor kids from escaping failing schools.</li>
<li>Losing arguments at the Supreme Court &mdash; including 13 unanimous losses in the last three terms, winning less than 40% of cases two years ago and barely more than half this past term.</li>

<p>But anyway, whether you call it a top 10 or baker&rsquo;s dozen, it&rsquo;s clear that, as one anonymous long-serving Justice Department lawyer <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/09/25/attorney-general-resigns-holder-one-worst-officials-ever-to-run-justice/" target="_blank">put it</a>, &ldquo;Holder is the worst person to hold the position of attorney general since the disgraced John Mitchell, who went to jail as a result of the Watergate scandal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As <a href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa560.pdf" target="_blank">critics of the conventional wisdom on failed states since 2006</a>, we have followed the evolution of the debate over state failure. So when we saw a new <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/01/well-governed-failed-states-not-an-oxymoron/" target="_blank">post</a> on Monkey Cage and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gove.12065/abstract" target="_blank">article</a> (ungated) in the journal Governance from Stephen Krasner and Thomas Risse on the subject, we read with interest.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">The debate over state failure is one that has shifted a lot.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were surprised to find that the arguments overlapped considerably with our own, but we were more interested to find the profound tension between Krasner&rsquo;s arguments regarding failed states today and his arguments on the subject when he was writing from the State Department in 2006 (as a Director of Policy Planning).</p>
<p>For instance, today Krasner and Risse write that their work debunks the &ldquo;conventional wisdom&rdquo; that &ldquo;failed states are supposed to be safe havens for terrorists, where anarchy, violence and chaos reign.&rdquo; The irony here is that Krasner very much helped create the conventional wisdom he is now arguing against. Consider the opening of a <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60832/stephen-d-krasner-and-carlos-pascual/addressing-state-failure" target="_blank">Foreign Affairs article he wrote with Carlos Pascual in 2005</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In today&rsquo;s increasingly interconnected world, weak and failed states pose an acute threat to U.S. and global security. &#8230; When chaos prevails, terrorism, narcotics trade, weapons proliferation and other forms of organized crime can flourish. &#8230; people become susceptible to the exhortations of demagogues and hatemongers&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Krasner and Pascual went on explicitly to cite Afghanistan in 2001 as an example showing that &ldquo;the problems of other countries often do not affect them alone.&rdquo; In their words, the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>elements of state weakness constitute structural threats akin to dead leaves that accumulate in a forest. No one knows what spark will ignite them, or when.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And make no mistake: Fixing failed states was about U.S. national security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Safety both here and abroad now depends on the ability of the United States and the international community to make sovereignty work &mdash; to establish democracies that improve the lives of ordinary individuals rather than of the ruling elite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what did this mean for policy, specifically? That the United States must be &ldquo;ready and able to manage all four postconflict stages,&rdquo; which were</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;stabilization,&rdquo; which involves &ldquo;enforcing order, feeding people, restarting basic services, initiating a political transition process, generating local employment, and reintegrating returning refugees and internally displaced persons.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Addressing &ldquo;root causes,&rdquo; which meant fixing problems like &ldquo;corruption, collapsed economic systems, political exclusion, or the private exploitation of public resources.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;the creation of the laws and institutions of a market democracy&mdash;or fostering the &lsquo;supply side&rsquo; of governance&rdquo; and finally</li>
<li>establishing &ldquo;the &lsquo;demand side&rsquo; of politics, essential for accountability&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind &mdash; in 2005-2006, this debate was taking place in the context of the Iraq War, and statements like that of Krasner and Pascual defined the conventional wisdom on failed states. These sorts of arguments were used to justify a large U.S. ground presence in Iraq and later Afghanistan, and they even helped stand up a standing nation-building office in the State Department that has since atrophied.</p>
<p>We were practically alone when we wrote at the time that this judgment of the alleged threats posed by failed states was obviously inflated, and that the policy program stemming from that threat inflation was breathtaking in scope, unattainable in practice and dangerous thinking to institutionalize in the national security bureaucracy.</p>
<p>One other lonely voice against the conventional wisdom back then was <a href="http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/1/0/7/p71075_index.html?phpsessid=31cp9d2ngqkf7ciuluh7tm7eg7" target="_blank">Alex Gourevitch, who suggested in 2005</a> that the entire discussion of fixing failed states was &ldquo;an eminently political discourse, counseling intervention, trusteeship and the abandonment of the state form for wide swaths of the globe.&rdquo; We think that the evolution of the debate <a href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/articles/fixing-failed-states.pdf" target="_blank">clearly validates this view</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Krasner writes with Risse not only that state failure is rare (and rarely threatening when it does happen), but also that state-building, democratization, and enhancing state capacity are usually well out of reach of Western interveners. These were precisely our points when we argued with the 2005 vintage Krasner.</p>
<p>The debate over state failure is one that has shifted a lot. Other scholars like <a href="http://www.cfr.org/world/weak-links/p24311" target="_blank">Stewart Patrick</a> have also moved in the skeptic direction.</p>
<p>For our part, and likely that of younger scholars, it would be interesting to find out how and why Krasner&#8217;s view has changed as much as it has.</p>

<p>Before becoming prime minister, India&rsquo;s Narendra Modi was barred from receiving a visa to visit the U.S. A rising leader in the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he was tied to deadly sectarian violence. But now he leads one of Asia&rsquo;s most important powers and the Obama administration is rolling out the red carpet.</p>
<p>India long was ruled by the dynastic Indian National Congress Party, which enshrined dirigiste economics as the state&rsquo;s secular religion. As a result, a land which spawned a global network of entrepreneurs and traders remained desperately poor.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, reality seeped into New Delhi. The Congress Party liberalized the economy. The BJP broke the Congress monopoly on power.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
<p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Prime Minister Modi&#8217;s visit to America offers an opportunity for a reset in bilateral relations.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>New Delhi appeared ready to follow the People&rsquo;s Republic of China to international superstar status. But then enthusiasm for economic reform ebbed, economic growth slowed, and conflict with Pakistan flared.</p>
<p>However, on May 26 Narendra Modi became prime minister. He is visiting the U.S. to speak before the United Nations and meet with President Barack Obama. The trip could yield rich benefits for both countries.</p>
<p>Of course, there was that embarrassing visa ban, the only one ever issued for that reason by Washington. The matter was quietly forgotten, though the underlying issue never was resolved.</p>
<p>While serving as the chief minister of the state of Gujarat in 2002, Modi was implicated in Hindu riots which killed over 1,200 people, mostly Muslims. It was generally agreed that some in his government were complicit in the violence. However, Modi escaped responsibility&mdash;some proclaimed him innocent, others contended that evidence had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Modi so far has focused on India&rsquo;s future. He was elected to reform the sputtering economy, which would not be helped by fueling religious hatred. To date his administration appears to be pragmatic and practical.</p>
<p>The prime minister&rsquo;s visit to America offers an opportunity for a reset in bilateral relations. The Bush administration made a major push to improve ties by accepting New Delhi&rsquo;s development of nuclear weapons, but little progress has occurred during the current administration. Indeed, controversies over trade policy and criminal charges against an Indian diplomat put the two governments at sharp odds.</p>
<p>The result is a lost opportunity for both nations. India, which, based on purchasing power parity, trails only America and China economically, so far performs far below its potential.</p>
<p>Modi naturally hopes to expand his nation&rsquo;s commercial ties throughout Asia, which increasingly is the world&rsquo;s economic center of gravity. But America remains the most important single state&mdash;with the largest (depending on measure), most sophisticated, and wealthiest economy.</p>
<p>Geopolitically, India has yet to play the international game as well as possible, though the new prime minister has embarked upon an ambitious travel schedule abroad. New Delhi&rsquo;s most persistent foreign antagonist is Pakistan. Building closer and more enduring ties with America would help India wean Washington away from its tight Pakistani embrace.</p>
<p>More important in the long-term is New Delhi&rsquo;s desire to develop international counterweights to China even while cooperating economically. Beijing remains well ahead of Delhi in most military and economic measures of power. However, Modi recently visited Tokyo, strengthening ties with another wealthy industrialized state as well as emerging counterweight to the PRC.</p>
<p>The greatest prize for New Delhi would be the U.S. The prime minister recently cited the improvement in bilateral relations <a target="_blank" href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/19/modi-on-the-indo-u-s-relationship/">and explained</a>: &ldquo;Our ties have deepened. India and the United States of America are bound together, by history and by culture. These ties will deepen further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Washington is thinking in similar terms. When Secretary of State John Kerry visited New Delhi in July, he said he wanted the two nations to become &ldquo;indispensable partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one expects a formal military alliance, which would be in neither nation&rsquo;s interest. And important issues will continue to divide the two capitals. But friendlier political relations, increased security cooperation, and enhanced trade and investment would remind the PRC that its growing power is matched by that of its wary neighbors.</p>
<p>India has further to travel than China to geopolitical greatness, but still matters today. New Delhi will matter much more tomorrow, especially if Prime Minister Modi commits his political capital to eliminate barriers to entrepreneurship, investment, and growth. Moreover, democracy gives the Indian people the ability to shape their own destiny.</p>
<p>The 21st century will be the Asian century, with a major assist from the United States. Most analysts presume Chinese dominance, but India could prove them wrong. If Barack Obama and Narendra Modi make a serious effort to overcome past differences, their governments could find themselves, like Rick and Captain Renault in the movie Casablanca, at the &ldquo;beginning of a beautiful friendship.&rdquo;</p>
