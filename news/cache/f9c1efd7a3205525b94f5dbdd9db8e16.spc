<p>It took Czech President Milo&#x161; Zeman 95 days since the parliamentary election to appoint the new coalition government led by Social Democrats last week. But that remarkable delay has been eclipsed by the person of the new finance minister, <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/01/09/czech-billionaire-babis-would-be-finmin-agent-of-change/" target="_blank">Andrej Babis</a>, a highly successful entrepreneur and maverick politician of Slovak origin. His rise to political prominence can mark a new era in Central European politics &mdash; an era in which close ties between big business and the government will become not only commonplace but shamelessly so.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Only time will tell what Babis&#8217;s true ambitions are.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In spite of having been founded only in 2012, Babis&rsquo; political party, ANO 2011 (&ldquo;ano&rdquo; means &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in Czech) finished second in the election in October last year, with 18.7 per cent of the popular vote &mdash; compared to 20.5 per cent earned by Social Democrats, defeating the remaining political incumbents by a wide margin. Had the election been held only a couple of weeks later, polls suggest, ANO would have easily gained the largest number of votes of all political parties.</p>
<p>The success can be attributed, in part, to the constant stream of news of political scandals, typically involving overpriced public procurement contracts. But it is also due to Babis aggressive marketing and his no-nonsense rhetoric, steering clear of any signs ideological commitment.</p>
<p>For outside observers and Czechs alike, it has been difficult to discern any consistent line of thinking in ANO&rsquo;s pre-electoral promises. Its manifesto is replete with general and sometimes contradictory ideas: it guarantees no further tax increases yet promises more investment spending for infrastructure. It intends to lower energy prices, regulate gambling and loan sharks, and attain self-sufficiency in the supply of essential foodstuffs.</p>
<p>In any event, policy specifics seem to be only an afterthought for this self-made entrepreneur &mdash; unlike his determination to succeed. In Summer 2013, with the election looming, Babis purchased the publishing house MAFRA, which owns the country&rsquo;s leading broadsheet newspapers, Lidova Noviny and Mlada Fronta Dnes. To his credit, there has been no evidence of interference with the work of journalists there, although the takeover prompted the resignation of the editor-in-chief of Mlada Fronta.</p>
<p>Some compare Babis to Silvio Berlusconi, but that does not do full justice to the role his businesses play in the Czech economy. Babis&rsquo; holding company, the Agrofert Group, comprises more than 200 firms, active in chemistry industry, agriculture, food processing, renewable energy, forestry, timber harvesting and woodworking. Agrofert is the largest Czech and Slovak agriculture and food group and the largest private employer in the Czech Republic, with some 27,000 employees.</p>
<p>While not universally considered the wealthiest Czech &mdash; that accolade has traditionally belonged to Petr Kellner, a financier currently active in Russia &mdash; Babis&rsquo; net worth was estimated at $2bn by the Forbes magazine in March 2013. He deflects any concerns about ties between big business and the world of politics with his staunch anti-corruption rhetoric and promises of a reform of public procurement standards and new degree of independence accorded to the Czech version of the government accountability office.</p>
<p>But what he really intends to do while in office remains an enigma. Maybe he will use his entrepreneurial acumen to fix Czech public finances. Although public debt is relatively low, the government has been running sizeable deficits in recent years, in spite of the austerity measures adopted by Babis&rsquo; predecessor, Miroslav Kalousek. Since those relied mainly on VAT increases, the country would benefit hugely from a thorough rethink of the structure of its public spending, which looks increasingly like the spending of the large welfare states West of Czech borders.</p>
<p>A more sinister &mdash; albeit perhaps more plausible &mdash; option is that Babis is entering politics for self-seeking purposes. Turning the Ministry of Finance into an Agrofert subsidiary would be certainly bad news for those who worry about the close ties between Czech politics and big business.</p>
<p>Only time will tell what Babis true ambitions are. As Miroslav Motejlek, a Czech business journalist, put it, &ldquo;[t]hat concentration of power in the hands of just one individual is so enormous that nobody &mdash; not even he &mdash; knows where it will lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>President Barack Obama predictably repeated his call for an increase in the minimum wage in his State of the Union. The president&rsquo;s story of how the owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis raised wages for employees like Nick Chute which &ldquo;eased their financial stress and boosted their morale,&rdquo; sounded good. That&rsquo;s because the idea of people pocketing more dough is something the American people can get behind. The problem is that a mandated minimum wage actually hurts more people like Nick than it helps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, despite the claim from the president and even some economists that &ldquo;increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers,&rdquo; the evidence tells a different story.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Focusing on the minimum wage ignores the policies that really would help the working poor.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is one telling example: Minimum wage increases in American Samoa between 2007 and 2009 had such crushing economic effects that President Obama himself signed a bill postponing increases scheduled for 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a massive body of research over more than 70 years that convincingly shows that the minimum wage is bad for the broader economy, results in job loss, and has little to no effect on reducing poverty. Worse, the minimum wage has proven to disproportionally hurt the people it was ostensibly put in place to help: the poor, the low-skilled and the uneducated. Any skeptics can find easily two recent comprehensive surveys of the literature. One is a 2012 survey by Mark Wilson available on the Cato Institute website. Another is a 2006 survey by David Neumark and William Wascherth available on the National Bureau of Economic Research website.</p>
<p>Advocates of an increase in the minimum wage often focus on employees of fast-food restaurants, hotel housekeeping staff and the like. The president and others seem unaware of the fact that nonprofit organizations hire many minimum wage workers. Think nursing homes and inner-city day-care centers. Think group homes for developmentally challenged children and recovering substance abusers. Think Goodwill Industries and Salvation Army.</p>
<p>How are these and many other nonprofits serving low-income families going to find the revenue to meet a higher minimum wage?</p>
<p>It is not hard to explain to the noneconomist why some studies suggest no effect of the minimum wage on employment. In the past, most changes in the minimum wage have been relatively small. Trying to sort out the effects of the increase from everything else going on requires high-powered statistics, and even then the effects can be buried by a host of other simultaneous disturbances and influences. If you accept as a fact that a minimum wage of, say, $50.00 per hour would reduce employment, and you accept as a fact that some workers are currently paid $7.25 per hour, then logic compels you to believe that a small increase in the minimum wage above $7.25 will have at least a small negative effect on employment.</p>
<p>Besides reducing employment, an inevitable impact of a higher minimum wage is increased prices for consumers &mdash; a class of people that includes those minimum wage workers with their new, higher paycheck. A higher wage has to come from somewhere &mdash; the tooth fairy won&rsquo;t provide it. A day-care center, for example, will have to raise its fees. A 2004 review of more than 20 minimum wage studies found that a 10 percent increase in the U.S. minimum wage raises food prices by up to 4 percent. However, the president isn&rsquo;t calling for a 10 percent increase, he wants a 39 percent increase. That&rsquo;ll take a bite out of the higher paychecks of minimum-wage workers, and everyone else.</p>
<p>Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 is good politics, but only if citizens fail to understand its negative effects. Focusing on the minimum wage ignores the policies that really would help the working poor, such as an expansion of the earned income tax credit. The EITC directs assistance to low-income wage earners, whereas some minimum wage earners are, for example, teenagers from wealthy families.</p>
<p>Another possible measure would be to provide federal assistance to help workers move to labor-short states. A wage above $7.25 is readily available to anyone willing to move to a low-unemployment area such as North Dakota.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Obama use his State of the Union address to propose policies that really would help low-income families? As a statesman instead of a politician, he could have provided real leadership on this issue instead of the warmed-over, ineffective, damaging minimum wage proposal.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/31/fact-sheet-opportunity-all-president-s-call-action-give-long-term-unempl" target="_blank">announced</a> that 300 companies &mdash; including Apple, Wal-Mart and others &mdash; have signed a pledge to help the long-term unemployed by making sure they don&#8217;t have barriers in their hiring practices.</p>
<p>This is good news, but it won&#8217;t solve the problem. The best we can hope for is that the companies now will make special efforts to seek out and employ those who have suffered long-term joblessness.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Obama should take a page out of the Reagan and Clinton presidencies and take action to get to the root of unemployment: economic growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a nice start, but feel-good gestures won&#8217;t cut it when there are almost <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t12.htm" target="_blank">4 million Americans</a> who have been out of work for more than six months. That&#8217;s a big number. What&#8217;s disconcerting is that the current long-term unemployment is more serious than in previous economic downturns. <a href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab12.htm" target="_blank">Data from previous business cycles</a> show people suffering from long-run joblessness at worst accounted for about 20% to 25% of the unemployed. In recent months, that percentage has jumped to nearly 40% &mdash; an all-time record!</p>
<p>Indeed, America is beginning to look like Europe. It used to be that long-term unemployment in the U.S. was only a fraction of Europe&#8217;s, but the latest data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that the United States has caught up to many of Europe&#8217;s welfare states.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a race we want to be part of, much less win.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the solution?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no silver bullet, but economic growth is the single most important key. All forms of unemployment get worse when the economy is weak. But when the economy is booming, the job market gets better for everybody &mdash; including those who have been unemployed for long periods.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, economic growth hasn&#8217;t proven easy. The recession may have ended officially in the summer of 2009, but we&#8217;re still suffering through a sluggish economic cycle. Recent improvements in the overall employment rate are in large part the result of people dropping out of the labor force, and the problem of long-run unemployment has barely budged.</p>
<p>To boost employment, we need the kind of strong growth America enjoyed during the Reagan and Clinton years, when <a href="http://politicalmathblog.com/?p=1819" target="_blank">millions of new jobs</a> were created and the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/us-unemployment-rate-history/" target="_blank">unemployment rate fell dramatically</a>. To get there, we need a return to the types of free-market policies we got under Reagan and Clinton: a lower burden of government spending and less intervention from Washington.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve been moving in the exact opposite direction. Under both Presidents Bush and Obama, the size and scope of government has expanded, and the United States &mdash; which had the world&#8217;s third-most free-market economy when Bill Clinton left office &mdash; has now dropped to 17th in the Economic Freedom of the World rankings.</p>
<p>We also need to make sure the unemployed don&#8217;t get lured into long-term dependency. One glaring example of misguided big-government policy is the argument to endlessly extend unemployment benefits. That sounds compassionate, but <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19499.pdf?new_window=1" target="_blank">according to economists</a> such policies discourage the unemployed from aggressively seeking new jobs.</p>
<p>There is also persuasive evidence that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/04/the-terrifying-reality-of-long-term-unemployment/274957/" target="_blank">employers are reluctant to hire people</a> (regardless of any “pledges” they may sign) who have been out of work for lengthy periods, which makes the President&#8217;s preferred approach of more unemployment benefits akin to an overprotective parent who hinders a child&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>Moreover, Obama&#8217;s proposed hike in the minimum wage would actually counteract any good his pledge would do. Why? Increasing the minimum wage is the equivalent of <a href="http://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/obama-advocates-higher-unemployment-for-lower-skilled-workers-and-some-great-election-news-from-colorado/" target="_blank">sawing off the bottom rungs on the economic ladder</a>. Simply stated, businesses create jobs when they think a new employee will help the bottom line. Artificially raising the cost of workers &mdash; particularly those with marginal skills &mdash; is a recipe for creating more unemployment.</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s effort to get companies on board with hiring the long-term unemployed should be applauded, but he shouldn&#8217;t for one second think that it will solve the problem. In fact, too many of his other proposals would serve only to exacerbate the problem the long-term unemployed are facing. Instead, Obama should take a page out of the Reagan and Clinton presidencies and take action to get to the root of unemployment: economic growth.</p>

<p>To hear Gov. Terry McAuliffe tell it, expanding Medicaid would provide hundreds of thousands of Virginians with better coverage, save hospitals and businesses more than $1 billion and stimulate the economy. Best of all, it would cost Virginia taxpayers hardly anything. Hallelujah, it&#8217;s a miracle!</p>
<p>The problem is that he is wrong about nearly all of it.</p>
<p>McAuliffe counts on roughly $14.7 billion in federal funding over the next 10 years to pay for most of the expansion. Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government would pay the entire cost through 2016.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Expanding Medicaid would cost Virginia taxpayers a substantial amount while providing the poor with substandard coverage.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, the federal share would gradually decline, but it is still supposed to pick up at least 90 percent of the cost for those made newly eligible in perpetuity. This is a much higher share of costs than Virginia receives under traditional Medicaid. McAuliffe sees this as virtually free money.</p>
<p>There are at least three big problems with this way of thinking. First, even though the feds will cover 90 percent, Virginians will have to pay 10 percent. Ten percent of a really big number is still a really big number.</p>
<p>Medicaid already is one of the biggest drivers of Virginia&#8217;s budget, accounting for more than 18 percent of spending. That&#8217;s significantly higher than the national average, and more than the state spends for transportation, public assistance or higher education.</p>
<p>Second, the increased federal funding applies only to Virginians added to Medicaid as a result of expanding eligibility to 138 percent of the poverty level. This ignores a second category of recipients likely to be added to the Medicaid rolls if this expansion moves forward, what the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has dubbed “the woodwork effect.”</p>
<p>As the Medicaid expansion moves forward, thousands of state residents will discover they are eligible under traditional Medicaid.</p>
<p>Some will be uninsured, but others will either be paying for insurance themselves or receiving it from their employer. It has been estimated that roughly 20 percent of new Medicaid recipients in Virginia would be “coming out of the woodwork.” This group is not eligible for the increased level of federal funding, meaning state taxpayers must pay 50 percent of their costs.</p>
<p>Overall, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates state taxpayers would have to pony up at least $1.3 billion in additional taxes through 2022.</p>
<p>Of course, any estimate assumes the federal government will keep its side of the bargain when it comes to future funding. But with Washington still facing a debt crisis, Medicaid will almost certainly be on the table.</p>
<p>Indeed, in budget negotiations, the Obama administration reportedly offered to cut the 90 percent funding promise for Medicaid expansion to a lower “blended rate formula.” While the administration has backed off that offer, it shows how tenuous federal funding promises really are.</p>
<p>Finally, Medicaid expansion wouldn&#8217;t necessarily provide poor Virginians with better access to health care. The Oregon Health Insurance Exchange study, the first randomized controlled study of Medicaid outcomes, recently concluded that “Medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured physical-health outcomes.”</p>
<p>Other studies show that, in some cases, Medicaid patients actually wait longer and receive worse care than the uninsured.</p>
<p>While Medicaid costs taxpayers a lot of money, it pays doctors little. On average, Medicaid reimburses doctors only 72 cents out of each dollar of costs. As a result, many doctors limit the number of Medicaid patients they serve or refuse to take them at all.</p>
<p>An analysis published in Health Affairs found that only 69 percent of physicians accept Medicaid patients. Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that Medicaid recipients were six times more likely to be denied an appointment than people with private insurance. And according to a third study, when they do get an appointment, they wait an average of 42 days to see a doctor, twice as long as the privately insured.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one reason why so many Medicaid patients show up at the emergency room for treatment. They can&#8217;t find a doctor to treat them otherwise.</p>
<p>McAuliffe is also wrong on his expectation that increased enrollment will keep people out of ERs and reduce the cost of uncompensated care. The Oregon study found that increased Medicaid enrollment actually increased ER use by as much as 40 percent. The result was an increase in annual emergency room spending by roughly $120 per covered individual. In Virginia, that would mean almost $100 million in additional ER costs per year.</p>
<p>In reality, expanding Medicaid would cost Virginia taxpayers a substantial amount while providing the poor with substandard coverage. It would encourage some recipients to drop private coverage and could make ER crowding and costs worse. That&#8217;s not quite the miracle that McAuliffe is counting on.</p>

<p>In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama demanded &ldquo;a year of action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what we really need, Reps. Ami Bera, D-Calif., and Chris Gibson, R-N.Y., suggested in their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/01/29/reps_chris_gibson_r-ny_and_ami_bera_d-ca_deliver_no_labels_sotu_response.html">SOTU response</a> for the post-partisan, good-government group No Labels, is &ldquo;a government of collaboration.&rdquo; Not in the Vichyite sense, don&#8217;t worry&mdash;what No Labels proposes is a government with a &ldquo;formula for how to get our leaders in Washington to start solving problems together again.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">It&#8217;s easy to make fun of No Labels; but it&#8217;s also important, because their empty pieties offer no real alternative to business as usual.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What that &ldquo;formula&rdquo; might be is never quite clear, but it starts with our representatives moving their flag pins to make room for new congressional &ldquo;flair.&rdquo; Over 70 members showed up to the SOTU sporting NL&#8217;s orange &ldquo;Problem Solvers&rdquo; pin. The standard, grammatically-challenged version says &ldquo;Committed to Fix Not Fight,&rdquo; but, for a night on the town, congressmen can download <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nolabels.org/choose-download-your-pin">sexier alternatives</a>, like &ldquo;Make Love, Not Gridlock&rdquo; or &ldquo;No More No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launched in 2010 to &ldquo;move America from the old politics of point-scoring toward a new politics of problem-solving,&rdquo; No Labels is back, with a &ldquo;three-year campaign to create a national strategic agenda&rdquo; and a new book, <em>No Labels: A Shared Vision for a Stronger America.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The grownups show up,&rdquo; gushes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8RC7EYRZJJ8">one Amazon reviewer.</a> But if these are the &ldquo;grownups,&rdquo; why do they come wearing happy-face buttons and spouting get-along bromides that might have been drawn from a middle-school &ldquo;No Putdowns&rdquo; campaign? Does Congress really need its own anti-bullying movement?</p>
<p>In the book&rsquo;s introduction, No Labels co-chairman Jon Huntsman laments the partisan state of the State of the Union: &ldquo;If we had a national strategic agenda this could all be different. The president and the leader of the opposition could meet before the State of the Union&rdquo; and &ldquo;get agreement on goals before the policy-making process starts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is how &ldquo;grownups&rdquo; are supposed to think about politics? When the old <em>New York Sun</em> started calling &ldquo;good government&rdquo; reformers &ldquo;goo-goos&rdquo; in the 1890s, they didn&#8217;t know the half of it.</p>
<p>NL&rsquo;s &ldquo;Problem-Solvers&rdquo; blog features a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube logo; as long as we&rsquo;re living in the &lsquo;80s, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the beef?&rdquo; is a relevant question. What is this &ldquo;national strategic agenda&rdquo; anyway?</p>
<p>It involves agreement on &ldquo;four essential goals&rdquo;: 1. 25 million new jobs; 2. Medicare and Social Security solvency; 3. balancing the budget; and 4. making America &ldquo;energy self-sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last item is mercantilist nonsense, but all four goals are already widely shared by pols. If we haven&#8217;t achieved them, &ldquo;it&#8217;s not because the solutions aren&#8217;t clear,&rdquo; No Labels argues, &ldquo;but because we haven&#8217;t focused our talents and resources.&rdquo; &ldquo;No one ever actually tells us how they plan&rdquo; to unite America, co-chairman Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., writes in the book&#8217;s foreword, &ldquo;in the pages ahead, you&#8217;ll read about the ?how.’&rdquo; Many platitudinous pixels later, the authors write that &ldquo;there will be a lot of tough decisions ahead. &#8230; in this book, however, we have purposely stopped short of suggesting which tradeoffs will be needed.&rdquo; I see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to make fun of No Labels; but it&rsquo;s also important, because their empty pieties offer no real alternative to business as usual.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of Congress&#8217;s archest ideologues have proven themselves capable of cross-aisle cooperation on important issues like National Security Agency reform. Socialist Bernie Sanders of Vermont and libertarian Justin Amash, R-Mich., have joined to tackle the problem of the surveillance state without the benefit of a &ldquo;Problem Solvers&rdquo; pin&mdash;as have Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Ill., and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., cosponsors of the <a target="_blank" href="http://sensenbrenner.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=356911">USA Freedom Act</a>.</p>
<p>Solving that problem will take a fight, but there&#8217;s no &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; without &ldquo;fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thailand has voted for the third time since the military staged a coup in 2006. The crony populists won again. The establishment thugs didn&#8217;t even compete. The country is headed toward more and more dangerous political turmoil.</p>
<p>The opposition no longer believes in democracy. Protestors in Egypt and Ukraine advocated new elections. In contrast, Thailand&#8217;s misnamed Democrat Party and its ally, the People&#8217;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), or so-called “Yellow Shirt” movement led by former DP deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban, attempted to block Sunday&#8217;s vote.</p>
<p>Thailand&#8217;s latest poll was triggered by PDRC mobs in Bangkok which sought to drive Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office. Although the protestors wear yellow, associated with the Thai monarchy, they are the modern equivalent of Benito Mussolini&#8217;s Black Shirts, who seized power through the infamous 1922 march on Rome.</p>
<p>The Thai political system is nominally democratic, but the military has staged multiple coups and dominated multiple governments. Even during civilian rule the state typically was controlled by an elitist establishment, essentially a military-royalist-civil service-business-urban/upper class axis. The monarch plays only a limited constitutional role, but anti-democracy activists use the revered king for political advantage.</p>
<p>The country faces extraordinary political turbulence. Wrote Nirmal Ghosh for the <em>Straits Times</em>: “Thailand&#8217;s conflict is complex and multilayered. It merges personality conflicts and revenge politics, class conflict, economic disparity and struggle over resources, and the fear of the urban middle class of a near future of rule by powerful corrupt politicians without the stabilizing presence of a morally strong and benevolent monarch.”</p>
<p>The ongoing political battle grows out of the 2001 victory of telecommunications executive Thaksin Shinawatra. He followed the traditional political strategy of tax, tax, spend, spend, elect, elect, offering financial benefits to the neglected rural poor.</p>
<p>Thaksin won another big victory in 2005, but the following year the so-called People&#8217;s Alliance for Democracy launched demonstrations to bring down his government. The military then ousted him in a coup. After rewriting the constitution to strengthen rule by establishment elites, the military held a new election in 2007, which was won by Thaksin&#8217;s successor party (though he remained in exile abroad).</p>
<p>The following year, in what has been described as the 1 percent rebelling against the 99 percent, PAD launched a series of protests to shut down the government &mdash; taking over Bangkok&#8217;s international airport and besieging parliament, for instance &mdash; and the security agencies refused to intervene. The courts stretched the law to oust Thaksin ally Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej as prime minister because he was paid to host a television cooking show. Then establishment pressure on the government&#8217;s coalition partners caused them to shift to make the DP&#8217;s Abhisit Vejjajiva prime minister even though his party had not won even a plurality of the vote since 1992.</p>
<p>In response angry Thaksin supporters, called “Red Shirts” &mdash; dominated by the rural poor and middle-class &mdash; flooded into Bangkok, filling the financial district and disrupting an international summit. The police and army rediscovered their commitment to public order and in 2009 cleared the streets, killing scores of protestors and injuring thousands of others. Opposition leaders were prosecuted and imprisoned.</p>
<p>However, Abhisit was overwhelmingly defeated in 2011 by Yingluck, Thaksin&#8217;s sister, and her Pheu Thai party. Last fall PAD relaunched itself as the PDRC and mounted large demonstrations after her government proposed an amnesty which would have allowed Thaksin, convicted in absentia of corruption charges, to return to Thailand.</p>
<p>As before, the opposition used storm trooper tactics. Suthep&#8217;s mobs seized public buildings, took over government ministries, blocked Bangkok streets, discussed occupying the stock exchange and shutting down the air traffic control system, and even threatened to kidnap the prime minister. The Thai Black Shirts met every failure by adopting more extreme tactics.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">The country is headed toward more and more dangerous political turmoil.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yingluck responded by calling an election and announcing that she would “let the people decide the direction of the country.” But that was the last thing the protestors wanted, since they knew they would lose. After two decades of electoral defeats the opposition views the ballot box as a problem, not a solution.</p>
<p>PRDC leader Anchalee Paireerak told the <em>New York Times</em>: an election “is not our objective.” The DP&#8217;s Theptai Seanapong, who resigned from parliament and refused to contest the new poll, admitted “We cannot beat them.” Sathit Wongongtoey, another protestor, complained: “they will return to power. We cannot allow that to happen.”</p>
<p>So the Black Shirts proceeded to block candidate registrations and early voting. Despite the deployment of 130,000 police to protect voters, protestors halted polling in several provinces and individual Bangkok polling places. The opposition now hopes to overturn the results.</p>
<p>Thaksin embodies the worst of irresponsible populism, the use of public office and funds to essentially buy votes. He has been convicted of corruption, though that ruling is tainted by the willingness of Thai courts to sacrifice justice in order to strengthen establishment rule.</p>
<p>As for Yingluck, complained journalist Wasant Techawongtham: “This is no democratic regime, and it is clear from all its past actions that it is using its power not for the nation&#8217;s interests but for the interests of its de facto leader Thaksin Shinawatra and his cronies in government.” Perhaps true, but that sounds a lot like most democracies. As H.L. Mencken observed, “every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods.” The operation and outcomes of democracy can be ugly, inefficient, unfair, even immoral. There is no better system, however.</p>
<p>Certainly not the one proposed by Suthep. His agenda is power. He called for a “people&#8217;s revolution” with an unelected “people&#8217;s council,” which he would get to fill, to “reform” election rules, which would guarantee his victory, before the next poll is held. Some of his supporters openly call for an absolute monarchy or other form of authoritarian state.</p>
<p>Like Thaksin, Suthep and his cronies are dedicated to their own interests. They just prefer the more discreet power-mongering and profiteering made possible when close-knit elites quietly dominate irrespective of election results.</p>
<p>Yet Suthep and his establishment friends insist on their right, and their right alone, to rule. His crowds evoke memories of fascist bullies in other nations cowing the majority and forcing their way into power. He claims to represent the nation but has only contempt for those who do not recognize his pretensions. On election day the Black Shirts even attacked Thais seeking to vote, throwing punches as well as water bottles and other objects. Four years ago Thaksin opponents demonstrated that they will rely on bullets if necessary.</p>
<p>Despite the Black Shirts’ efforts, Prime Minister Yingluck was reelected. Under normal circumstances she would form a new government. But it will take a miracle for Thai politics to soon begin working normally again.</p>
<p>Creation of a stable administration accepted by the opposition is the least likely result. The Democrat Party has abandoned electoral politics, the establishment loathes the popular majority, Suthep is determined to take power irrespective of his lack of popular support, and the Black Shirts want to make the country ungovernable. The latest electoral loss is only likely to enrage what have become perennial sore losers.</p>
<p>Yingluck&#8217;s opponents may file charges of alleged electoral violations and urge the Election Commission to nullify the vote. That could trigger large and violent demonstrations from the Red Shirts; attorney Verapat Pariyawong predicted the result would be “more blood on the streets.” By blocking candidate registrations the Black Shirts prevented the poll from filling the required 95 percent of parliament&#8217;s seats. By-elections will be necessary before the body can open, leaving Yingluck a weak caretaker in the meantime. Moreover, Suthep&#8217;s mobs will attempt to prevent those votes from proceeding.</p>
<p>The opposition also may turn to the courts, long a reliable ally. The National Anti-Corruption Commission is investigating Yingluck&#8217;s role in a much-criticized rice subsidy program. Both the Supreme and Constitutional Court are hearing a number of highly political charges which could result in a ban of Yingluck, top Yingluck officials, and her entire party. However, Red Shirt activists, who so far have avoided violently challenging the Black Shirts, are unlikely to peacefully accept a judicial coup. There already have been isolated gun shots and bombings, though no one has taken responsibility.</p>
<p>If all else fails, the Black Shirts are likely to take more radical steps to overthrow the new government. Chaos in Bangkok, and especially violent clashes with Yingluck supporters, might cause the military to stage another coup, though the armed forces leadership so far has remained neutral. The 2006 coup leader, Sonthi Boonyaratglin, opposes such a takeover: “If you love the country and the king, you better stop thinking about it.” He warned that the military likely would face violent resistance from not just the Red Shirts but the “mass” of people.</p>
<p>King Bhumibol Adulyadej&#8217;s frail health adds another complication. A source of national unity, the ailing 86-year-old no longer is able to moderate political passions. The crown prince is disliked, leading to proposals to pass the crown to one of his siblings. At the same time, the Thai economy is heading south as investors drop or postpone plans. Increased instability and violence will worsen the country&#8217;s economic prospects.</p>
<p>In short, Thailand&#8217;s political future looks at best uncertain and at worst disastrous. Absent self-restraint, which has been entirely lacking, the only hope may be constitutional reform reducing central government power. In fact, this might offer a rare opportunity for consensus: both sides seem inclined toward devolution, including electing provincial governors. If Bangkok was less dominant and regions could chart their own course, the Red Shirts and Yellow Shirts would have less incentive to battle to the political death and might agree to a political armistice.</p>
<p>Thaksin may be a blight upon Thai politics, but Suthep and his allies are a cancer. Unfortunately, in Thailand democracy does not guarantee good government. However, authoritarian, undemocratic rule would be far worse.</p>
<p>There is no easy answer to Thailand&#8217;s problems. But Suthep&#8217;s Black Shirts will bear the primary blame if their nation descends further into violence and disorder.</p>

<p>Obamacare, both as written and as executed, violates the Constitution in so many ways. The latest example has arrived at the Supreme Court by way of the &ldquo;contraceptive-mandate&rdquo; cases&mdash;<a href="http://www.becketfund.org/hobbylobby/" target="_blank"><em>Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby</em></a> and <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/8451" target="_blank"><em>Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius</em></a>&mdash;which will be argued March 25.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Obamacare forces some business owners to choose between operating their businesses in a way that violates their deeply held religious principles or running them into the ground.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the issue: Among the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s thousands of pages is a requirement that companies with more than 50 employees provide coverage for certain medical services or else face severe penalties. These mandated services include methods of contraception that prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg, which some people believe means destroying life. Obamacare thus forces some business owners to choose between operating their businesses in a way that violates their deeply held religious principles or running them into the ground.</p>
<p>Several of the companies affected by the contraceptive mandate sued the government, with conflicting rulings emerging from the lower courts. Last week, I proudly filed an <a href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/hobby-lobby-filed-brief.pdf">amicus brief</a> on the Cato Institute&#8217;s behalf supporting these challengers.</p>
<p>The question here is not whether a for-profit corporation has religious beliefs or enjoys a right to freely exercise religion.  The real question is whether individuals who wish to conduct their business lives in accordance with their religious beliefs forfeit the right to do so when they organize their businesses as corporations.</p>
<p>That question answers itself. A corporation is <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1873158" target="_blank">a legal fiction</a> created to foster economic activity, not a construct to shelter businesses from religious influence. There&#8217;s nothing inherent in the corporate form that requires people who use it to surrender their right to conduct business in a way that comports with their morality. And Congress, in passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act&mdash;which has broader protections than even the First Amendment&mdash;didn&#8217;t intend to restrict the religious liberties people enjoy in their business affairs based solely on how those affairs are organized under civil law.</p>
<p>Whether a corporation can exercise religion may be an interesting philosophical question, but there&#8217;s no need for a court to address it when legislation regulating that corporation also restricts the religious liberty of the individuals who own it and direct its affairs.  The key fallacy in the government&#8217;s position is its assumption that because a corporation has a distinct legal status, there&#8217;s no personal dimension to corporate decision-making.</p>
<p>The reality, of course, is that a corporation can act only at the direction of human beings. Any government compulsion of a corporation is thus also felt by those individuals.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t check their religious values at the office door. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized repeatedly that a person may exercise religion in virtually every phase of life. For many people, religion determines the school they attend, the food they eat, the person they marry, and the place they work. It dictates how they lead their lives, how they raise their children, and how they are mourned when they die. For that reason, the Court has declined to limit free exercise rights to any particular activity.</p>
<p>Inevitably, a great deal of religiously motivated action occurs in the workplace. Indeed, corporate decision-makers are often faced with moral choices&mdash;ranging from wages to working conditions to competitive practices&mdash;that squarely implicate religious teachings. And when these officials believe that they&#8217;re bound by faith to steer their corporation in a particular direction, that action is plainly rooted in the <em>individual&#8217;s</em> religious belief.</p>
<p>The government simply can&#8217;t force people to forfeit their free exercise rights when they incorporate a business&mdash;just as it can&#8217;t force them to forsake these liberties when they enter the workforce, attend school, or engage in any other secular pursuit.  More to the point, there&#8217;s nothing about the act of incorporation (or commerce generally) that necessarily amounts to a waiver of individual free exercise rights.</p>
<p>The best way for the Court to approach these cases is to affirm that the right to &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; one&rsquo;s religion includes the freedom to implement one&rsquo;s religious beliefs in every phase of life&mdash;and that a law compelling action by a corporation can also amount to a substantial burden on the free exercise rights of those who create and control it. Such a holding would do no more than ensure that individuals retain the same rights to exercise religion in their professional endeavors as they do in other aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>The fact is that the corporate form is an essential tool for operating successfully in the complex modern economy. The choice the government would put to pious businesspeople is, therefore, untenable: Subject yourself to a severe competitive disadvantage by surrendering the protection of the corporate form, or lose the right to order your professional live in accordance with your faith.</p>
<p>Nobody should have to choose between the two.</p>

<p>In the accompanying table, I have ranked countries (the major economies, plus two good examples &mdash; Chile and Switzerland) on three fiscal variables. The first one is the net of their growth rate and deficit for 2013 (i.e., growth rate minus deficit).</p>
<p>For most of the major countries, their deficits were greater than their rate of economic growth, giving them a net negative number.</p>
<p>The other variables I listed are government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), and government gross debt as a percentage of GDP. Lower levels of government spending are associated with higher rates of economic growth and vice versa.</p>
<p>Government debt levels of more than 90 percent of GDP tend to slow economic growth because of the crowding out of private capital and the cost of debt service which, at some point, can spiral completely out of control.</p>

China, South Korea, Chile, Switzerland, Russia and Australia are all in good fiscal shape. China, as everyone knows, has made spectacular progress over the past 35 years, going from a poor country to a low-middle-income country. 
<p>However, with China, there are always questions about continued political stability. At the moment, the country is dealing with a debt bubble, which could greatly depress economic growth.</p>
<p>Russia is too dependent on natural resources, and a big decline in oil and gas prices and exports could cause a sharp drop in growth. As with China, there is political risk, as well as an unstable Ukraine next door.</p>
<p>Chile, Switzerland and Australia are solid democracies under the rule of law, with South Korea a bit less so. Chile&rsquo;s growth is likely to slow somewhat as it moves a little to the left under its new president.</p>
<p>The Swiss and the Australians are both rich and sensible, and hence, even though they cannot avoid being harmed by a new global recession, they almost certainly will do better than most other countries.</p>
<p>India and Brazil were global investors&rsquo; favorites up to a year or so ago. During the good times, both allowed sloppy fiscal habits to re-emerge &mdash; too much wasteful spending, poor regulation and crony capitalism. Both are likely to do less well in 2014.</p>
<p>Germany and Canada are in good shape despite having too much government, but both countries have reduced the size of government in the past three years, which is largely responsible for their relatively good performance.</p>
<p>The Canadians always suffer from weakness in the U.S. economy, and the Germans are being pulled down by their fellow Europeans and a disastrous foray into green energy that caused energy prices to soar.</p>
<p>The United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan and Spain are in deep trouble. They all have way too much government and debt &mdash; and crony capitalism &mdash; and their debt burdens as a percentage of GDP continue to grow. This means slower growth, or worse, over the longer run.</p>
<p>None of these countries has the political leadership that appears to be capable of dealing with the entitlement problems they all face.</p>
<p>Italy, Spain and Japan have a demographic crisis, where the elderly, dependent population is rapidly outgrowing the number of workers. As a result, their economies are in a slow death spiral.</p>
<p>Most world economies, and all of the major world economies, are very fragile at the moment, and any shock could cause a new global financial meltdown.</p>
<p>The world may luck out as it has for the past two years, but if the major economies do not soon get their fiscal houses in order, the risk will continue to grow. Then, the well-being of billions of people will go &ldquo;poof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did Harry Reid kill the trade agenda? The Senate Majority Leader is no champion of economic freedom to be sure, but his opposition to the fast track bill doesn&#8217;t kill it. It merely strengthens the hand of his colleagues who might support a more protectionist version of the legislation. It&#8217;s an invitation to negotiate.</p>
<p>Those who may have thought a fast track bill could be plopped down and rammed through a skeptical Democratic caucus &mdash; especially with its only Democratic sponsor, Senator Max Baucus, not sticking around to see it through &mdash; failed to account for history or for the consequences of the president&#8217;s refusal to do anything to soften the ground for trade legislation in Washington. If the trade agenda implodes, blame President Obama and nobody else. His failure to invest in a straightforward narrative to reassure doubters and explain trade&#8217;s enormous benefits has yielded commensurate dividends.</p>
<p>While he has encouraged his trade negotiators’ to bring home big “21st Century” trade deals, which include rules that penetrate more deeply into what was once considered domestic policy space, the president has never attempted to assuage concerns, correct misconceptions, or make an affirmative public case for why trade (or these new rules) are essential to the nation&#8217;s prosperity. That has left a vacuum gladly filled by organized, anti-trade interests, who have spread rumors and preyed on the public&#8217;s worst fears.</p>
<p>During the past year, as domestic opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was metastasizing, the administration issued nary a peep in rebuttal to allegations of imminent job losses, erosion of labor and product safety standards, environmental catastrophe, loss of internet freedoms, inaccessibility to medicines, threats to the food supply chain and other aspects of public health, or the acquiescence of policy making to multinational corporations. That silence lent credibility to claims that were mostly absurd, inspiring more opposition. The White House seems never to have anticipated the need to engage in domestic dialogue or negotiations that would require the president to not only stand up to his traditional allies on the Left, but to stand with congressional Republicans.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So reluctant is President Obama to challenge Democratic Party dogma with the specifics of his trade agenda that he decided, instead, to kick that can down the road for three years, as his negotiators went full steam ahead on TPP and launched the transatlantic talks without adequate knowledge of the trade negotiating objectives and parameters Congress would demand in exchange for the fast track consideration of those deals he now seeks. Despite the administration&#8217;s assurances that Congress was being kept in the loop about the TPP every step of the way, the idea of retrofitting the fast track language to the terms of TPP, instead of the other way around, was always presumptuous and risky, and that approach has rubbed some legislators the wrong way. Whatever political potholes the president sought to avoid by bypassing fast track authority at the outset have grown deeper and wider.</p>
<p>What explains this illogical tack? Uncertainty? Timidity? Both, and perhaps a heavy does of ambivalence.</p>
<p>The president remains deeply conflicted on trade, beholden to incongruous beliefs. He acknowledges the imperative of U.S. global economic engagement, but seems also to believe that trade exacerbates income inequality and environmental degradation. He likes the idea of boosting exports, but cannot manage to accept the fact that trade agreements also mean more import competition. For those who fail to see trade as the mutually beneficial exchange between willing parties that it is but instead view it as a zero -sum game between “us” and “them,” imports are to be minimized &mdash; and their impact swept under the rug, if you&#8217;re a politician unwilling to take a stand.</p>
<p>As I elaborated in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danikenson/2013/12/06/the-presidents-indifference-imperils-the-trans-pacific-partnership/" target="_blank">this column</a> two months back:</p>
<blockquote>
 <div>
  Presumably, the president&#8217;s reluctance reflects the reality that his party in Congress largely opposes trade agreements. More than 150 of 200 House Democrats have registered their opposition to granting their president TPA [Trade Promotion Authority]. He knows how they feel. He was with them not too long ago, and part of him may still be. As has been the case for five years, the president remains unwilling to challenge his party&#8217;s orthodoxy or to pick a fight with congressional Democrats or the unions and environmental groups to whom they are beholden.
 </div>
</blockquote>
<p>A president who says he will “work to enact bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers and environment and to open markets to new goods stamped ‘Made in the U.S.A’,” is reinforcing the myths that sustain trade&#8217;s skeptics and hindering, not helping, the effort. Those words do not constitute leadership on trade. Those are the words of protectionists.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the president is uncomfortable making an affirmative, public pitch for the trade agenda his administration has pursued and, in some sense, wishes this whole trade liberalization thing would just go away. In that regard, by saying “no” and “not now,” Senator Reid has given the president license to continue to equivocate, as he waits to see where the winds blow in Congress on this.</p>
<p>If fast track is granted, the White House can spin whatever amendments were made to the original bill as sensible improvements sought by Democrats in keeping with the president&#8217;s promises to protect the interest of workers and the environment. If fast track is rejected or derailed until after the election, the White House can blame congressional Republicans and business for being too unwilling to compromise.</p>
<p>But how the president ultimately spins it depends on which outcome he actually favors. At this late stage, the jury&#8217;s still out.</p>

<p>Argentina&#8217;s luck is finally starting to run out. It devalued its currency by 15 percent <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303947904579338640681887288" target="_blank">last week</a>, marking the beginning of a possible economic crisis of the kind Argentina has become known for. Argentina&#8217;s problem is that it has followed the logic of populism for more than a decade and President Cristina Kirchner is showing no interest in changing course.</p>
<p>In the 1990s Argentina combined far-reaching but sometimes flawed market-reforms with irresponsible fiscal policies, culminating in its 2002 default on $81 billion in debt—the largest sovereign default in history. The country delinked its currency from the dollar, experienced a severe economic crisis, and initiated its current period of populist politics.</p>
<p>Those policies included price controls on domestic energy, reneging on contracts with foreign companies, export taxes, more public sector employment and vastly increased spending. When you don&#8217;t pay massive debts, you get temporary breathing room, so growth resumed. High commodity prices and low global interest rates that lifted demand for Argentine exports also helped produce Argentine growth.</p>
<p>But the government&#8217;s appetite has consistently grown faster, and, with little ability to borrow abroad, it has turned to other sources of finance. In 2008, Kirchner nationalized private pension funds worth some $30 billion, and has since nationalized an airline and a major oil company. As it drew down reserves, the government turned to printing money to finance itself, falsifying the inflation rate it says is about 11 percent, but which independent analysts put at about 28 percent. Economist Steve Hanke estimates it is <a href="http://www.cato.org/research/troubled-currencies-project">much higher</a> at 74 percent</p>
<p>The imposition of price controls on items such as food and electricity and controls on capital have only produced scarcities and the emergence of a black market exchange rate that values the peso some 50 percent under the official rate. In other words, people are putting far less worth in the currency than the government would like. The partial devaluation of the peso last week was an effort by the government to close that gap, and discourage speculating against the currency. But so far that hasn&#8217;t happened. The black market rate of the peso fell along with the official rate. It looks like the government&#8217;s move will undermine confidence in the Argentine economy even further.</p>
<p>We can expect worse not only because of the arbitrary way Buenos Aires makes policy and thus spreads uncertainty; a more fundamental reason is that the Kirchner regime has shown no interest in taming inflation or the high level of spending it finances. Indeed, as the graph below from Argentine economist Luis Secco shows, the size of government has exploded in the last decade. Secco calculates that public spending grew from 22 percent of GDP in 2002 to an estimated 44 percent in 2013.</p>
<p class="center"><a href="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/images/arg-photobg1.jpg"><img src="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/images/arg-photosm1.jpg" alt="image" style="border: 0px;" /></a></p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t the first time that Argentina has lived beyond its means. The last time it did so, public spending grew 97 percent from 1991 to 2001, while the economy grew by only 57 percent. Argentines remember how that episode ended. This time around Argentina has no recourse to international credit. As long as Buenos Aires insists on an unsustainable size of government, inflation and capital flight will continue, future devaluations will occur, and Argentina&#8217;s downward spiral will accelerate.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Costa Ricans will go to the polls in what many consider the most important presidential election in a generation.</p>
<p>At stake is the future of an economic model that over the last 25 years has produced robust economic growth but has failed to significantly reduce the poverty rate. Unfortunately, a bad reading of the economic policies implemented by a succession of conservative and social-democratic administrations over the last three decades could lead voters to follow the siren song of populism.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Many Costa Ricans mistakenly believe that economic liberalization is to blame for the country&#8217;s social woes.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The groundwork for a populist shift has already been laid. Rampant corruption, social stagnation and growing inequality have provided fertile soil in other Latin American nations for the rise of populist candidates &mdash; and Costa Rica is no exception.</p>
<p>The lead-up to the election has been marked by widespread national dissatisfaction, and according to surveys, corruption is voters’ main concern. After eight years in power, the National Liberation Party has become synonymous with cronyism and embezzlement.</p>
<p>This is the reason that a Socialist congressman, Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Villalta, is one of the leading candidates. His platform calls for policies similar to those disastrously implemented in Venezuela, like land distribution, punitive taxes on big corporations, price controls and the nationalization of key industries.</p>
<p>His claim that the country&#8217;s economic liberalization of the last 30 years has failed the masses resonates among a large segment of the electorate. But Mr. Villalta&#8217;s policy prescriptions are based on a wrong diagnosis of Costa Rica&#8217;s economic model.</p>
<p>After an acute crisis from 1980 to 1982 swelled the poverty rate to 54 percent, Costa Rica put in place reforms to move the economy toward an export-oriented model. The country set exchange rates to provide more certainty to exporters and established free-trade zones and entered into free-trade agreements with the United States, the European Union and China, among others. It also privatized inefficient state-owned enterprises and opened certain industries to competition.</p>
<p>These reforms brought significant growth. Since 1987, Costa Rica has been growing an average of 4.7 percent a year, one of the fastest rates in Latin America.</p>
<p>But since 1994, poverty has remained stagnant and income inequality is on the rise. In fact, Costa Rica is one of only three Latin American countries where inequality has risen since 2000.</p>
<p>And this has happened despite the fact that Costa Rica has one of Latin America&#8217;s highest social expenditures: The government has 44 anti-poverty programs, plus large entitlement programs like social security and state-provided health insurance.</p>
<p>So why has Costa Rica been unable to lower its poverty rate despite healthy growth rates? Because its economic model is still in significant ways based on a mercantilist system that is biased toward certain favored sectors of the economy (exports, tourism) at the expense of the poor.</p>
<p>Take, for example, monetary policy. Over the last 30 years the Costa Rican central bank has actively intervened in the foreign exchange market to boost the export-related sectors of the economy, even though doing so has driven inflation as high as 14 percent in 2005, the highest rate in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Trade policy is another problem. While Costa Rica opened up to imports in the early 1990s by cutting tariffs on many consumer goods, it maintains high tariffs on a number of key farm goods like milk, rice and chicken, which drives up prices.</p>
<p>And yet these are precisely the products most consumed by the poor. A 2002 study by Costa Rica&#8217;s Incae Business School found that agricultural protectionism constituted a 17.5 percent income burden on the poorest 20 percent of the population. In 2013, the cost of a basic basket of food products required to meet an average person&#8217;s minimum caloric intake represented 82 percent of the average per capita income of the poorest Costa Ricans.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, while the Costa Rican government offers tax and regulatory incentives to multinational companies, it suffocates local businesses with high taxes and crippling regulations. The country ranks 102 (out of 189 economies) in the World Bank&#8217;s Doing Business Report. The total tax rate amounts to 55.3 percent of an average local business&#8217;s profit. As a result, many people can&#8217;t cope with the high costs of doing business and turn to the parallel economy: The latest data show that one in three Costa Ricans work in the informal sector.</p>
<p>Many Costa Ricans mistakenly believe that economic liberalization is to blame for the country&#8217;s social woes. In reality, the current economic model is designed to benefit powerful sectors of the economy at the expense of the overall population, particularly the poor. What Costa Rica needs are genuine market reforms that eliminate the government&#8217;s power to pick winners and losers. Let&#8217;s hope the voters can see past the empty promises of populism next week.</p>

<p>The Obama administration has launched the first attack in a carefully planned war on conservative and libertarian political speech. In November, the IRS proposed &ldquo;clarifying&rdquo; the rules that govern the political activity of 501(c)(4) &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; groups, many of which have been branded by the left as nefarious &ldquo;dark money&rdquo; cabals. By clarifying the rules, the IRS hopes to provide guidance on how much, and what kind, of political activity (c)(4)s can engage in. In reality, the IRS is using the tax code to discourage conservative political speech.</p>
<p>There are of course both liberal and conservative (c)(4)s, but, since 2010, conservative (c)(4)s and other &ldquo;outside money&rdquo; groups have greatly <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?cycle=2012&amp;chrt=V&amp;disp=O&amp;type=A" target="_blank">outspent</a> liberal ones. Coming from a president who has publicly <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/02/koch-brothers-obama-campaign-americans-for-prosperity-donors_n_1316537.html" target="_blank">chided</a> conservative (c)(4)s for not revealing their donors, it is not surprising that he would turn to the ultimate bully in the bully pulpit: the IRS.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a step back. In order to have (c)(4) status, an organization must be organized &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; around social welfare and community activity. For decades, this language has been interpreted by lawyers to mean that a (c)(4) can&rsquo;t spend more than 50 percent of its funds on political activity, and the IRS largely went along with that rule of thumb. Of course, the next question is: &ldquo;what is &lsquo;political activity&rsquo;?&rdquo; And it is here these clarifying rules become a thinly disguised political power game.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">The IRS is using the tax code to discourage conservative political speech.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the proposed rules, &ldquo;candidate-related political activity&rdquo; now includes nearly everything that most (c)(4)s do, including voter registration, voter guides, grassroots lobbying, events where candidates appear, candidate debates, and issue advocacy. This means that many (c)(4)s would have to count nearly all their activities as political spending, even though the rules remain unclear on what percentage of spending can be on &ldquo;candidate-related political activity.&rdquo; Not coincidentally, the new rules don&rsquo;t apply to labor unions, which are not (c)(4)s and therefore can still do all those things without running afoul of the IRS.</p>
<p>Want to create a (c)(4) to organize a grassroots campaign to encourage voters to email their member of Congress to oppose the Farm Bill? That is now a &ldquo;candidate-related political activity&rdquo; and must be included as part of your organization&rsquo;s political spending. Want to hold a voter registration drive that doesn&rsquo;t mention any candidates? That is also considered &ldquo;candidate-related political activity&rdquo; under the proposed rules. Even commenting on nominees, such as a Supreme Court justice, can be &ldquo;candidate-related political activity&rdquo; even though there is no candidate mentioned.</p>
<p>Some may ask why politically active social welfare groups are getting special tax status from the IRS in the first place. They&rsquo;re not. In fact, contributions to (c)(4)s aren&rsquo;t tax deductible, and most (c)(4)s are organized around social welfare issues that are inexorably intertwined with politics, such as Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club, and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.</p>
<p>A better question to ask is: what evil is the IRS trying to eliminate? When did pushing for ideas and critiquing public figures&rsquo; stances become something bad? When did we start caring more about who is saying something rather than what is being said?</p>
<p>Anonymous political speech was essential to American history. Would Thomas Paine&rsquo;s <em>Common Sense</em>, originally published anonymously, now be called &ldquo;candidate-related political activity&rdquo; funded by &ldquo;dark money?&rdquo; Would the anonymous <em>Federalist Papers</em> get administrative review from the IRS and an exposé in <em>Mother Jones</em> on the &ldquo;secret money behind the Constitution?&rdquo; The country that pioneered the strongest protections for free speech in history is becoming obsessed with the idea that there are people out there trying to illegitimately &ldquo;influence&rdquo; politics.</p>
<p>King George III would have of course been happy to shut up Thomas Paine with an obscure section of the tax code. Similarly, the Anti-Federalists might have jumped at the chance to expose the authors behind the Federalist Papers and to report their publishing costs as &ldquo;candidate-related political activity.&rdquo; As we&rsquo;ve recently seen, the IRS is often used as a cudgel against political opponents, and this time it is no different. The proposed rule has all the indications of being a planned effort by the administration to squelch opposition speech.</p>
<p>After all, nothing in Washington, D.C. this important to an election happens by accident.</p>
<p>The rule just &ldquo;happened&rdquo; to be proposed on November 29th, the Friday after Thanksgiving. Not only did this obscure the rule from the news cycle, it put one-third of the required 90-day notice-and-comment period in December, a month where much of D.C. is on vacation or otherwise not involved. Furthermore, unlike nearly every other rule that goes into effect 30 days after the final rule is published, the (c)(4) rules go into effect the day they are published.</p>
<p>If the rule is published in the proposed form, then there are many (c)(4)s from both the left and the right that will simply have to go dark because nearly all of their activities will be considered &ldquo;political.&rdquo; They can reorganize as a 527 group, but then they will have to disclose donors, which was the administration&rsquo;s goal from the outset. The left then can employ their favorite fallacious argument: ad hominem attacks on donors rather than ideas.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, this rule will be published without heeding the suggestions of any comments from interested groups. After that, the court cases will begin to pile up, and some claims will likely be successful. Legal victories, however, will not come soon enough to forestall the effects on the 2014 and 2016 elections. How convenient&#8230;</p>

<p>Apparently President Obama has become convinced that he can make magic with that pen he keeps talking about, the one he plans to use for signing executive orders to revive his beleaguered presidency. Executive orders are irresistible, because a president doesn&#8217;t have to propose anything, debate the issues, endure hearings or solicit votes. An executive order can be issued in a few minutes &mdash; behind closed doors and away from bright lights.</p>
<p>Paul Begala, who was an advisor to President Bill Clinton, reportedly remarked, &ldquo;Stroke of the pen, law of the land, kinda cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What about the Constitution? It describes presidential power broadly. There isn&rsquo;t anything in the Constitution that authorizes an executive order or limits what a president can do with it.</p>
<p>Executive orders arise from &ldquo;implied constitutional and statutory authority,&rdquo; the Congressional Research Service reported. &ldquo;If issued under a valid claim of authority and published in the <em>Federal Register</em>, executive orders may have the force and effect of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many executive orders are in a twilight zone of dubious constitutional legitimacy if not open defiance of the Constitution, especially when they amount to lawmaking without congressional approval.</p>
<p>Presidents have made extravagant claims with their executive orders, as Harry Truman did when he issued executive order 10340 that directed the Secretary of Commerce to stop a steelworkers strike by seizing privately-owned steel mills. Truman insisted that a prolonged strike would impair the government&rsquo;s ability to fight his undeclared &ldquo;police action&rdquo; in Korea. Truman&rsquo;s Solicitor General Philip B. Perlman declared that Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution &ldquo;constitutes a grant of all the executive powers of which the Government is capable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The case came before the Supreme Court as <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</em>, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). Justice Robert Jackson &mdash; like Truman, a Democrat &mdash; was incredulous at the administration&rsquo;s position. He said, &ldquo;The example of such unlimited executive power that must have most impressed the forefathers was the prerogative exercised by King George III. The description of its evils in the Declaration of Independence leads me to doubt that they were creating their new Executive in his image. Continental European examples were no more appealing. And, if we seek instruction from our own times, we can match it only from the executive powers in those governments we disparagingly describe as totalitarian. I cannot accept the view that the clause is a grant in bulk of all conceivable executive power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice Hugo Black, another Democrat, wrote the majority opinion invalidating the seizures. Black explained that an executive order (1) &ldquo;must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself&rdquo; and (2) an executive order is on dubious ground if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There have been thousands of executive orders, so it&rsquo;s hard for government to keep track of them all, and it&rsquo;s even harder for ordinary citizens. In 1974, the Senate Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers was surprised to discover that &ldquo;Since March 9, 1933, the United States has been in a state of declared national emergency. There are now in effect four presidentially-proclaimed states of national emergency. In addition to the national emergency declared by President Roosevelt [during the Great Depression], there are also the national emergency proclaimed by President Truman on December 16, 1950, during the Korean conflict, and the states of national emergency declared by President Nixon on March 23, 1970 and August 15, 1971.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The committee report continued, &ldquo;These proclamations give force to 470 provisions of Federal law, delegating to the President extraordinary powers, ordinarily exercised by the Congress, which affect the lives of American citizens in a host of all-encompassing manners&#8230;The President may seize property, organize and control the means of production, seize commodities, assign military forces abroad, institute martial law, seize and control all transportation and communication, regulate the operation of private enterprise, restrict travel, and in a plethora of particular ways, control the lives of all Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>President Obama&rsquo;s admirers like to talk about the wonderful things can be done with executive orders, but the historical record has been mixed. Some have been fine, while many have backfired badly.</p>
<p>Executive orders go back to the beginning of our country, although they weren&rsquo;t called that. Usually they were referred to as proclamations.</p>
<p>President George Washington&rsquo;s first proclamation was on October 3, 1789. He said, &ldquo;Both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving.&rdquo; This was authorized by Congress.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s Neutrality Proclamation wasn&rsquo;t authorized by Congress. Issued on April 22, 1793, it declared that the United States would be neutral in the war between France and Great Britain, which had begun two months before. Members of Washington&rsquo;s cabinet, including Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, agreed that the United States was too fragile to become involved in another war. So far, so good.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">While executive orders are attractive to presidents because they can be issued quickly, they can be revoked quickly, too.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abraham Lincoln expanded presidential powers via proclamations and executive orders. He did this in the name of suppressing rebellion rather than waging war, since the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war.</p>
<p>In April 1861, a Maryland militia officer named John Merryman was arrested and detained at Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He was said to have damaged Union facilities and trained Confederate soldiers. His lawyer obtained a writ of habeas corpus from Chief Justice Roger B. Tawney who directed George Cadwalader, the commander at Fort McHenry, to produce Merryman and explain the facts and the legal basis for detention. Cadwalader refused, saying that Lincoln had suspended habeas corpus. Tawney cited him for contempt, but a marshal couldn&rsquo;t enter the fort to deliver the contempt citation. Tawney wrote what became known as the <em>Ex Parte Merryman</em> opinion, saying, in part, that &ldquo;If the authority which the Constitution has confided to the judiciary department may upon any pretext be usurped by the military power, the people of the United States are no longer living under a government of laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On September 24, 1862, Lincoln issued a proclamation officially suspending habeas corpus, which meant that the government could detain people indefinitely. Lincoln &ldquo;managed the home front, in part,&rdquo;historian Mark E. Neely, Jr. reported, &ldquo;by means of military arrests of civilians &mdash; thousands and thousands of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln had issued executive orders expanding the amount of Union territory subject to military control, particularly southern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio where &ldquo;copperheads&rdquo; were operating. In 1864, the Union army arrested Lambdin Milligan and four others in southern Indiana. They were charged with plotting to free Confederate prisoners-of-war. A military court sentenced the men to death, but they appealed for their constitutional right to habeas corpus. After the Civil War, in 1866, the Supreme Court noted that Indiana wasn&rsquo;t under attack, and civilian courts were functioning, so Milligan and the others were entitled to a jury trial there. Justice David Davis wrote: &ldquo;The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of protection all classes of men, at all times, in all circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Historian James G. Randall reflected, &ldquo;No president has carried the power of presidential edict and executive order &mdash; independently of Congress &mdash; so far as [Lincoln] did. It would not be easy to state what Lincoln conceived to be the limit of his powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s best-known executive order was the Emancipation Proclamation. He hoped to provoke a slave revolt in the Confederacy and make it easier for the Union to win the Civil War. Accordingly, on September 22, 1862, he issued a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. It applied to any state that didn&rsquo;t return to the Union by January 1, 1863. No states returned. At that point, Lincoln issued the historic Emancipation Proclamation. It applied to slaves in the Confederacy &mdash; territory that the Union didn&rsquo;t control. It neither abolished slavery nor extended citizenship to former slaves, but it did make the abolition of slavery a war aim.</p>
<p>Until the early 20th century, executive orders were generally undocumented. They were addressed to a particular government agency which had the only copy. Nobody seemed to know how many executive orders there were. As late as the 1930s, there was an account, published in the <em>New York Times</em>, claiming that &ldquo;there are no readily available means of ascertaining the true texts and history of the thousand or more executive orders issued since March 4, 1933.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peacetime expansion of federal power began with Theodore Roosevelt who issued 1,006 executive orders, more than any previous president. They performed a wide range of administrative functions, especially the disposition of government-owned land.</p>
<p>TR emphatically rejected the view that &ldquo;what was necessary for the nation could not be done by the President unless he could find some specific authorization to do it&#8230;it was not only [the president&rsquo;s] right but his duty to do anything that the needs of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the Constitution or by the laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TR also said: &ldquo;I think [the presidency] should be a very powerful office, and I think the President should be a very strong man who uses without hesitation every power the position yields.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;I believe in a strong executive. I believe in power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to biographer Henry Pringle, &ldquo;It seldom occurred to Roosevelt that the duty of the executive was to carry out the mandates of the legislative. In so far as he was able, he reversed the theory. Congress, he felt, must obey the president.&rdquo; He wanted the Supreme Court to obey him, too. Roosevelt acknowledged, &ldquo;I did greatly broaden the use of executive power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At times, TR seemed drunk with power, as when he remarked: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that any harm comes from the concentration of power in one man&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woodrow Wilson issued 1,791 executive orders. For instance, executive order 1810 (August 7, 1913) prohibited anyone from operating a flying machine or balloon across the Panama Canal Zone.  Wilson issued executive order 1860 (November 11, 1913) to dictate interest rates for the Canal Zone &mdash; a surprising number of Wilson&rsquo;s executive orders had to do with administering that little territory.</p>
<p>Most of Wilson&rsquo;s executive orders were issued during World War I. For instance, on April 14, 1917, he issued executive order 2594 to establish the Committee on Public Information &mdash; war propaganda. On April 28th, he issued executive order 2604 for censorship of messages sent via the trans-Atlantic cables. Executive order 2679-A (August 10, 1917) established the Food Administration. Executive order 2697 (September 7, 1917) required that anyone wishing to export coins, bullion or currency must file an application in triplicate with the nearest Federal Reserve bank. Executive order 2736 (October 23, 1917) authorized Food Administrator Herbert Hoover to requisition food. Executive order 2953 (September 12, 1918) authorized the sale of property seized in accordance with the Trading with the Enemy Act.</p>
<p>Franklin D. Roosevelt issued 3,723 executive orders, more than any other U.S. president. In his Inaugural Address, he said: &ldquo;I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the [depression] crisis &mdash; broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On March 6, 1933, FDR issued Proclamation 2029 that cited Wilson&rsquo;s Trading with the Enemy Act to justify ordering banks closed for a National Bank Holiday.</p>
<p>FDR sent his Emergency Banking bill to the House of Representatives, and it was passed after only 38 minutes of debate &mdash; apparently without members reading it.</p>
<p>In 1933, FDR issued executive order 6102 that made it illegal for Americans to own gold bullion or gold certificates, even though historically gold provided the best protection against inflation and monetary crises. Violators faced the prospect of a fine up to $10,000 or up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Since economic fascism was popular during the early 1930s, FDR issued executive orders to suspend antitrust laws and establish German-style cartels in dozens of industries, restricting total industry output, allocating market shares and fixing above-market wages and prices. Above-market wages discouraged employers from hiring, and above-market prices discouraged consumers from buying, so these executive orders weren&#8217;t good for the country. Among them:</p>
<p>* 6204-A, for the rayon weaving industry</p>
<p>* 6205-C, for the silk manufacturing industry</p>
<p>* 6216, for the ship building and ship repairing industries</p>
<p>* 6242-B, for electrical manufacturing</p>
<p>* 6248, for the corset and brassiere industries</p>
<p>* 6250, for theaters</p>
<p>* 6253, for the fishing tackle industry</p>
<p>* 6254, for the iron and steel industries</p>
<p>* 6255, for the forest products industry</p>
<p>* 6256, for the petroleum industry</p>
<p>* 6543-A, for the drapery and upholstery industries</p>
<p>With executive orders, FDR multiplied the number of government bureaucracies. He established the Civilian Conservation Corps by issuing executive order 6101. The Public Works Administration followed with executive order 6174. Then came these executive orders:</p>
<p>* 6225, the Central Statistical Board</p>
<p>* 6340, the Commodity Credit Corporation</p>
<p>* 6420-B, the Civil Works Administration</p>
<p>* 6433-A, the National Emergency Council</p>
<p>* 6470, the Public Works Emergency Housing Corporation</p>
<p>* 6474, the Federal Alcohol Control Administration</p>
<p>* 6514, the Electric Home and Farm Authority</p>
<p>* 6581, the Export-Import Bank of Washington</p>
<p>* 6623, the Federal Employment Stabilization Office</p>
<p>* 6632, the National Recovery Review Board</p>
<p>* 6770, the Industrial Emergency Committee</p>
<p>* 6777, the National Resources Board</p>
<p>* 7027, the Resettlement Administration</p>
<p>* 7034, the Works Progress Administration</p>
<p>While some of the programs provided relief for desperate people, they failed to achieve a sustained revival of private sector job creation. Indeed, relief spending was the main reason government spending doubled and taxes tripled during the New Deal era (1933-1940). Where did the tax revenue come from? The biggest source of federal revenue was the federal excise tax on cigarettes, beer, soda, chewing gum and other cheap pleasures consumed disproportionately by poor and middle income people. This means the cost of relief programs for poor and middle income people was borne mainly by poor and middle income people. In May 1939, FDR&rsquo;s Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau lamented, &ldquo;We are spending more than we have ever spent before, and it does not work. After eight years of this administration, we have just as much unemployment as when he started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New Deal unemployment averaged 17 percent, and it didn&rsquo;t go down significantly until the government began removing more than 10 million men from the civilian work force via military conscription for World War II.</p>
<p>FDR&rsquo;s most controversial executive order was 9066 which he issued on February 19, 1942. It established the War Relocation Authority to forcibly move Japanese-Americans away from the Pacific Coast into &ldquo;relocation camps&rdquo; for the duration of World War II. About 70 percent of these people were second-generation, born in the United States. Three individuals, Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi and Minoru Yasui, were convicted of refusing to comply with internment. The case went up to the Supreme Court which upheld FDR&rsquo;s executive order in <em>Korematsu v. United States</em>, 323 U.S. 214 (1944). The majority opinion asserted that protecting against potential Japanese espionage was more important than protecting individual rights. Six of FDR&rsquo;s 8 appointees sided with him against the interned Japanese. The lone Republican appointee, Owen Roberts, was opposed.</p>
<p>FDR&rsquo;s Solicitor General Charles Fahey, who argued the case before the Supreme Court, allegedly suppressed reports by the FBI and the Office of Naval Intelligence, showing that there wasn&rsquo;t any evidence Japanese-Americans posed a security threat to the United States. The suppressed reports came to light years later, and the convictions were overturned November 10, 1983 by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, thereby eliminating the case as a possible precedent for future arbitrary imprisonment.</p>
<p>President Nixon issued two executive orders that had unfortunate consequences.</p>
<p>On August 15, 1971, he announced his New Economic Policy, which happened to be what Bolshevik firebrand Vladimir Lenin called one of his misadventures. Nixon issued executive order 11615 that declared: &ldquo;to stabilize the economy, reduce inflation, and minimize unemployment, it is necessary to stabilize prices, rents, wages, and salaries.&rdquo; These controls failed to stop inflation which hit double-digits during the 1970s, and they caused chronic shortages, rationing and business disruption &mdash; making it harder to create private sector jobs. By maintaining below-market prices, controls simultaneously encouraged producers to provide less, while encouraging consumers to demand more. Hence, the shortages.</p>
<p>Although this experience with price controls had been a flop, Nixon decided to try again. On June 13, 1973, he signed executive order 11723 that called for a freeze on prices, while he continued to control wages, salaries and rents.</p>
<p>Nixon&rsquo;s executive orders made a bad situation worse. For instance, his price control administrator C. Jackson Grayson confessed: &ldquo;lumber controls were beginning to lead to artificial middlemen, black markets and sawmill shutdowns. Companies trapped with low base-period profit margins were beginning to consider selling out those with higher base periods, sending their capital overseas, or reducing their efforts. Instances of false job upgrading &mdash; which were actually &lsquo;raises&rsquo; in disguise &mdash; were reported. To keep away from profit-margin controls, companies were considering dropping products where costs, and thus prices, had increased. And shortages of certain products (like molasses and fertilizer) were appearing because artificially suppressed domestic prices had allowed higher world prices to pull domestic supplies abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1999, Bill Clinton waged war with executive orders. He issued executive order 13088 that declared the governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Republic of Serbia posed &ldquo;an extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&rdquo; Therefore, Clinton proclaimed a &ldquo;national emergency.&rdquo; He ordered the seizure of property belonging to the named governments in the United States, and he prohibited Americans from conducting commercial transactions with those governments. Clinton&rsquo;s executive order 13119 declared that the region was a war zone. Executive order 13120 summoned military reserve units for active duty.</p>
<p>None of this was authorized by Congress. On the contrary, Congress voted down a resolution to declare war. Congress wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;authorize&rdquo; the air war. Clinton ignored Congress and kept America in the war. When, on June 10, 1999, NATO announced it was over, Clinton ordered American soldiers to serve in the Kosovo Force.</p>
<p>Not long after that, we found ourselves in an open-ended national emergency declared on September 14, 2001 and extended since by both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. This means the president has standby powers from hundreds of statutes that would enable him to re-introduce military conscription, seize private property and in myriad ways establish a government-run economy.</p>
<p>How could an executive order be revoked?</p>
<p>First, an executive order can be revoked by another executive order. Probably all presidents revoke some executive orders by their predecessors.</p>
<p>For example, Bill Clinton&rsquo;s executive order 12919, issued on June 3, 1994, was about national security. It revoked all or part of more than a dozen executive orders issued between 1939 and 1991.</p>
<p>President Obama revoked executive orders 13258 (2002) and 13422 (2007), both of which were issued by George W. Bush, and Obama amended executive order 12866 (1993) which had been issued by Bill Clinton. These executive orders had to do with regulatory processes.</p>
<p>So, while executive orders are attractive to presidents because they can be issued quickly, they can be revoked quickly, too.</p>
<p>Second, an executive order can be revoked by legislation. Reportedly every president since Grover Cleveland has had some of his executive orders modified or revoked by legislation.</p>
<p>The Congressional Research Service cited a number of examples: &ldquo;in 2006, Congress revoked part of an executive order from November 12, 1838, which reserved certain public land for lighthouse purposes. Congress has also explicitly revoked executive orders in their entirety, such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which revoked a December 13, 1912 executive order that created Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 2.&rdquo; An executive order by President George H.W. Bush, to establish a human fetal tissue bank for research purposes, was revoked when Congress declared that &lsquo;the provisions of Executive Order 12806 shall not have any legal effect.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Third, an executive order can be revoked by a federal appeals court or the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>For example, President Clinton&rsquo;s executive order12954 prohibited the federal government from hiring contractors who replaced strikers. He argued that strikers can become violent when they&rsquo;re replaced, so it would be better to appease strikers and support union workplace monopolies by banning replacements.</p>
<p>But executive order 12954 conflicted with a 7-0 U.S. Supreme Court decision in <em>NLRB v. Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Company</em>, 304 U.S. 333 (1938),. In part, that court decided &ldquo;[The employer] is not bound to discharge those hired to fill the places of strikers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>D.C. Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman said, &ldquo;We think it untenable to conclude that there are no judicially enforceable limitations on presidential actions [enabling] the President to bypass scores of statutory limitations on governmental authority.&rdquo;  Accordingly, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit revoked Clinton&rsquo;s executive order in <em>Chamber of Commerce v. Reich,</em> 74 F.3d 1322 (D.C. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p>While executive orders look like an easy option for a beleaguered president, they increase the temptation to over-reach. They&rsquo;re likely to inflame controversy and motivate opponents to further mobilize their forces. In the end, when opponents come to power again, whatever has been established with executive orders is most vulnerable to being swept away by a whirlwind.</p>

<p>President Obama&rsquo;s State of the Union Address Tuesday night was solidly crafted, well delivered, and &mdash; with the notable exception of his stirring tribute to Sgt. 1st Class Cory Remsburg &mdash; utterly forgettable.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the speech, we were led to believe that the president would talk about big ideas, that he would make a clarion call for a &ldquo;year of action&rdquo; centered on &ldquo;income inequality.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">The president played small ball, embracing a Clintonesque medley of poll-tested proposals that sounded like action, without actually doing much of anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But instead of swinging for the fences, the president played small ball, embracing a Clintonesque medley of poll-tested proposals that sounded like action, without actually doing much of anything. One hoped nostalgically for a mention of midnight basketball.</p>
<p>Some of his proposals &mdash; patent reform, immigration reform, reworking the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and increased trade &mdash; do hold potential, though the devil, as always, will be in the details. But for the most part, the speech was simply a tired reiteration of a liberal wish-list.</p>
<p>In his 2013 State of the Union, President Obama called for Congress to take up 42 items. Congress ended up enacting just two. That left a lot left over for this year, and the president dutifully recycled the golden oldies: green energy subsidies, gun control, universal preschool, and so on.</p>
<p>There was a little something for pretty much every potential Democratic voting block. The key word here is &ldquo;little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The president&rsquo;s call to raise the minimum wage was typical. He had made the exact same promise last year, and there is no reason to believe it more likely to pass this time around.</p>
<p>Even if it did, raising the minimum wage would do little to achieve the president&rsquo;s professed goal of ensuring that &ldquo;no one who works full time … [has] to raise a family in poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contrary to the president&rsquo;s implication, less than five percent of those earning the minimum wage are heads of households living below the poverty level.</p>
<p>For every poor person that would benefit from the president&rsquo;s proposal, four beneficiaries would live in households with incomes above 300 percent of poverty.</p>
<p>The president&rsquo;s plan would help a lot of college students and second-earners, but low-skilled, low-income workers would be as likely to lose their jobs as to benefit.</p>
<p>Even the president&rsquo;s vaunted threat to act without Congress turned out to be inconsequential. The big item was an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10/hour. But the president&rsquo;s order will, at best, affect only 150,000-200,000 workers. In addition, it only applies to future contracts, not ongoing work, meaning its immediate impact will be almost nonexistent.</p>
<p>After that, the president was left asking businesses to voluntarily follow the example of a Minneapolis pizza restaurateur and raise wages voluntarily, because it&rsquo;s good for employee morale. No doubt, businesses had never thought of that.</p>
<p>The president recalled last year&rsquo;s promise to &ldquo;connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years.&rdquo; By this year, that had been downsized to: &ldquo;a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was also more talk about high-tech manufacturing hubs. They aren&rsquo;t bad ideas necessarily, but we&rsquo;ve been there, done that, and bought the T-shirt already.</p>
<p>The same is true for the president&rsquo;s call for a review of federal job training programs. Considering that the federal government currently runs 47 such programs without much evident success, a review sounds like a good idea. But haven&rsquo;t we heard that before too?</p>
<p>When it came to ObamaCare, the president seemed to spend more time pleading with people to sign up than he did defending his signature achievement. And, when he wasn&rsquo;t asking mothers to &ldquo;get on your kids to sign up,&rdquo; he was asking Republicans to please stop trying to repeal it. That didn&rsquo;t exactly sound like success.</p>
<p>The president did claim that some 9 million Americans had received health insurance thanks to the law, but that number is almost ludicrously misleading.</p>
<p>Six million of those people haven&rsquo;t received actual insurance, but have simply been pushed into Medicaid.</p>
<p>Of the three million enrolled in private insurance, only 70 percent have actually paid for a policy, and more than two-thirds of those were previously insured &mdash; but had lost their current policies because of Obamacare.</p>
<p>Counting them as an ObamaCare triumph is a bit like breaking a man&rsquo;s leg, then claiming credit for giving him a crutch.</p>
<p>Overall, the president spoke for a long time &mdash; more than 65 minutes &mdash; and, by some counts, made at least 22 specific promises. But in the end, it sounded an awful lot like the quack of a lame duck.</p>

<p>In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Obama repeated one of the biggest lies behind the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and it wasn&rsquo;t that you could keep your health-care plan or your current doctor. In fact, most people don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s a lie.</p>

<p>That became obvious when he received a standing ovation after saying it: &ldquo;Because of this law, no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain, or cancer.&rdquo; The president and his supporters keep pretending that, before the ACA, an insurance company could drop individual policyholders, when in reality it could not.</p>
<p>Comes as a shock, doesn&rsquo;t it? But the truth is that for decades there have been safeguards in our health-insurance system to protect people just like the physician&rsquo;s assistant, Amanda Shelley, mentioned by the president.</p>
<p>Before 1996, if you purchased individual health insurance through a broker, you would have been offered a &ldquo;guaranteed renewability&rdquo; option. This would guarantee that your policy could not be canceled if you developed an expensive and chronic condition. The insurance company would also have to renew the policy on its anniversary date without charging a higher premium because of the chronic condition. This option was so popular that, by 1996, 75 percent of people buying individual health insurance also bought the guaranteed-renewability option.</p>
<p>Then, in 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Among HIPAA&rsquo;s many mandates was the requirement that all individual insurance plans have guaranteed renewability. It also prohibited all group health-insurance plans sold to businesses from denying coverage to individuals because of preexisting conditions.</p>
<p>And so, for the past 18 years, all insurance companies have been legally forbidden from dropping an individual policyholder who developed a chronic illness and have not been able to raise anyone&rsquo;s rate because of it.</p>
<p>Moreover, Medicare covered anyone age 65 or older regardless of preexisting conditions. Ditto for the indigent on Medicaid. Yet a major goal of the ACA supposedly was to address the problem that some people couldn&rsquo;t obtain insurance because they had preexisting conditions that rendered them either &ldquo;uninsurable&rdquo; or insurable only for an unaffordable premium.</p>
<p>These are people who do not already have individual or group health insurance and are not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid. An example would be someone who lost his job and his employer-provided insurance, has a chronic illness, and has exhausted his coverage under COBRA. Just what percentage of the non-Medicare/non-Medicaid population could have this problem? According to a 2001 survey by the Department of Health and Human Services, corroborated by other academic studies, just 1 percent of the under-65 population has ever been denied health insurance.</p>
<p>Ironically, the president tried to minimize the failure of his &ldquo;like your plan, keep your plan&rdquo; pledge by arguing, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about 5 percent of the population.&rdquo; In his State of the Union, he didn&rsquo;t mention the 5 percent, which comes out to approximately 5.4 million Americans, who had their plans canceled because of the ACA. Instead, he patted himself on the back for helping free people from &ldquo;substandard plans&rdquo; that, he claims, would have dropped them if they developed some chronic and costly illness.</p>
<p>So to address a problem afflicting a minute portion of the under-65 population, Congress committed trillions of dollars to drop a nuclear bomb on the U.S. health-care system, remaking it in the image of your local DMV. For a tiny fraction of those trillions, Congress could have adopted one or more of the many alternative solutions to the problem faced by that small group of people, from the promotion of &ldquo;health-status insurance&rdquo; to the creation of viable high-risk pools.</p>
<p>It is difficult to decide what is more infuriating: the dishonesty or the incompetence of the designers of the Rube Goldberg scheme known as the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<p>The very core of what makes America different from all other nations is our Constitution&#8217;s separation of powers.</p>

<p>Here is James Madison in Federalist Paper No. 51: “In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others.”</p>

<p>He went even further: “It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part.” </p>

<p>But here comes our commander-in-chief, who customarily tosses the separation of powers into the nearest wastepaper basket. Dig this recent headline from bizpac.com, which summed up Barack Obama&#8217;s approach to passing legislation in 2014: “&#8201;‘I&#8217;ve got a pen and I&#8217;ve got a phone’: Obama says he&#8217;ll run right over Congress this year” (Michael Dorstewitz, Jan. 15). </p>

<p>Now Obama has been publicly glorifying the extent of his seemingly boundless executive powers, as Justin Snow reported for <em>Metro Weekly</em>:</p>

<p>“With a portrait of George Washington looking down at him, Obama told reporters gathered in the Cabinet Room of the White House” &mdash; referring to his all-powerful “pen and phone” &mdash; that he is ready to bypass Congress if necessary to get things done (“Obama&#8217;s executive order problem,” Justin Snow, <em>Metro Weekly</em>, Jan. 17).</p>

<p>Obama discussed taking “executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward in helping to make sure our kids are getting the best education possible and making sure that our businesses are getting the kind of support and help they need to grow and advance to make sure that people are getting the skills that they need to get those jobs that our businesses are creating.”</p>

<p>Should any of you ever get the chance to be in Obama&#8217;s royal presence, make sure to bow properly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that declaration reveals what can continue to happen for the rest of his reign unless a due process impeachment procedure soon becomes possible.</p>

<p>How can the impeachment process happen? We The People must be heard resoundingly, because &mdash; as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson warned &mdash; it&#8217;s up to us to remain Americans.</p>

<p>Very soon after first taking office, as I&#8217;ve reported previously, President Obama actually prevented trials from being held accusing him of unilaterally using “renditions” &mdash; kidnapping alleged terrorists from the streets of their countries to be taken to nations known for torturing suspects. He used the state secrets privilege to close off our system of justice more often than Bush ever did. Since then, Obama has not forbade renditions. And because renditions are classified, we don&#8217;t know who has been taken where. </p>

<p>And as I often remind you, because most of the media has gone to sleep on this, in 2011, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which, for the first time in our history, permitted the military to arrest and detain U.S. citizens indefinitely &mdash; including in this country &mdash; for allegedly being “associated” with terrorists, without evidence presented before an American court.</p>

<p>If these reminders of Chinese justice don&#8217;t add pressing cause for an impeachment investigation, what on earth will? </p>

<p>Jeffrey Kuhner of <em>The Washington Times</em> has written previously about Obama&#8217;s expansion of power, which makes King George III look rather puny by comparison:</p>

<p>Back in March 2012, “the White House released an executive order, ‘National Defense Resources Preparedness.’ The document is stunning in its audacity and a flagrant violation of the Constitution. It states that, in case of a war or national emergency, the federal government has the authority to take over almost every aspect of American society. Food, livestock, farming equipment, manufacturing, industry, energy, transportation, hospitals, health care facilities, water resources, defense and construction.”</p>

<p>All of this could come under the control of President Obama &mdash; or whoever is holding the office.</p>

<p>“The order empowers the president to dispense these vast resources as he sees fit during a national crisis &#8230;</p>

<p>“The executive branch is arrogating responsibilities precluded by the Constitution without even asking the permission of Congress. The order gives Mr. Obama a blank check to erect a centralized authoritarian state &#8230;”</p>

<p>“The backdrop to the executive order is the looming showdown with Iran. The administration says the ‘window for diplomacy is closing’&#8201;” (“Obama&#8217;s power grab,” Jeffrey Kuhner, <em>The Washington Times</em>, March 22, 2012).</p>

<p>How much of this range of executive power, domestically and internationally, will remain under the next president? How much of it will animate the 2014 congressional campaigns, as well as the next presidential race? How many of us are even aware of these precedents that are being set for this America?</p>

<p>And as vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, who will be the next president to attempt to fill them? </p>

<p>This question haunts me more and more: How many kids in school now (and those to come) have any debatable idea of what&#8217;s going on with our Constitution? Do they understand how Obama&#8217;s uses of executive power have changed what used to be America&#8217;s rule of law and our globally distinctive values?</p>

<p>Have I disturbed your sleep at all?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been overshadowed by the hoopla surrounding the State of the Union, but we have finally had an outbreak of bipartisanship in Washington. Of course, bipartisanship means, as it usually does, that Democrats and Republicans have teamed up to mug taxpayers: An agreement has finally been reached on a new farm bill.</p>
<p>The farm bill will cost taxpayers about $950 billion over the next ten years. Lawmakers are calling this a $23 billion cut. But as Veronique de Rugy and my colleague Chris Edwards have <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/369558/cuts-farm-bill-still-leave-it-more-expensive-previous-one-veronique-de-rugy" target="_blank">pointed</a> <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/new-farm-bill-much-larger-last-one">out</a>, this is a cut only in the Washington sense of spending less than previously predicted. In reality, it represents an inflation-adjusted $258 billion increase over the ten-year cost of the last farm bill, in 2008. That&rsquo;s a whopping 37 percent jump in real spending!</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">In a bipartisan development, Democrats and Republicans team up, again, to mug taxpayers.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The largest part of this spending is not for farm programs but for food stamps. The bill provides approximately $756 billion in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through 2023. The media will certainly point out that this is roughly an $8 billion cut in such spending over ten years, but that represents just 1 percent of the program&rsquo;s funding. Virtually all of the savings comes from eliminating the so-called LIHEAP loophole, under which some 17 states were able to leverage token (often as little as $1) fuel-assistance payments into higher food-stamp benefits. Any serious attempt to reform the program by, say, reinstating work requirements was dropped. Is it any wonder that the Department of Agriculture reports that a record 20 percent of American households now receive food stamps?</p>
No doubt conservatives will complain about the food-stamp spending, but whatever one thinks about our ever-growing safety net, there is simply no excuse for the farm portion of the bill, which is pure corporate welfare. 
<p>After all, while no one would deny that farming can be a difficult and sometimes precarious way of life, farmers generally are not suffering. In 2013 the average farm household had an income of $104,525. In 2011, the most recent year a direct comparison is available, farm-household incomes were 25 percent higher than the average for all U.S. households, and this gap has only increased since. Moreover, much farm aid goes not to small family farms but to giant agri-business. Among the biggest recipients of farm subsidies are Tysons Food, Pilgrim&rsquo;s Pride, and Riceland Foods, none of which are likely to be the subject of a Lifetime TV movie anytime soon. In fact, roughly a third of subsidies in the last farm bill went to the wealthiest 4 percent of farmers.</p>
<p>The bill does make some promising reforms, notably eliminating direct payments to farmers. And, while the bill preserves dairy-price supports, it doesn&rsquo;t include the so-called stabilization program that would have mandated production quotas to keep prices up.</p>
<p>But all the money saved from eliminating direct payments has been redirected to expanded crop insurance, through which the federal government covers losses from poor yields or low commodity prices. Subsidies will actually increase for rice and cotton farmers, while corn, wheat, and soybean farmers will also continue to be major beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 949-page bill is packed with pork and giveaways to favored groups.</p>
<p>For example, the bill includes $1.5 million in funding this fiscal year to strengthen and enhance &ldquo;the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.&rdquo; It also creates a National Christmas Tree Board, funded through a 15-cent tax on every Christmas tree sold. The bill maintains the Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s $17 million per-year catfish-oversight program, even though the Food and Drug Administration has a nearly identical program (which costs a mere $7 million a year!). The Department of Agriculture will also be establishing new federal standards for &ldquo;the identity of honey.&rdquo; Apparently even bees are helpless without the federal government.</p>
<p>It is particularly disappointing to see self-professed conservatives such as Representatives Dennis Ross, Tom Rooney, Vern Buchanan, and Steve Southerland sending out press releases hailing special-interest goodies like $25 million per year for a federal Citrus Research and Extension Initiative.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the legislation maintains the federal sugar program, a combination of import restrictions and production quotas that keeps the price of American sugar well above the world market.</p>
<p>The legislation could come up for a vote in the House as early as Wednesday. Undoubtedly it will be hailed as an example of how Congress can &ldquo;get something done&rdquo; when they &ldquo;all work together.&rdquo; Sadly, that is probably true.</p>

<p>Immigration reform is alive and well in 2014. Speaker John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, recently said he would pursue it but, &ldquo;one step at a time.&rdquo; So if a step-by-step process is how immigration reform is going to get done, there are three critical components that must be included for it to be a success.</p>
<p>The first is creating a workable legal immigration system for low-skilled guest workers. Currently, there is little to no immigration opportunity for low-skilled immigrants. Instead, there are expensive, overly regulated and numerically limited guest worker visa programs that aren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">For immigration reform to be a long-term success, the nature of immigration must be understood.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take the H-2A visa for seasonal agricultural workers for example. Four different federal agencies regulate it, and the fines, fees and bureaucracy associated with it are so great that George W. Bush&rsquo;s secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao, said, &ldquo;Many who have tried report such bad experiences that they stopped using it altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just 65,345 H-2A visas were issued in 2012 but there are 300,000 to 400,000 unauthorized immigrants working in farming alone. That&rsquo;s not to say immigrants prefer to work illegally. In fact, when a workable legal channel was in place in the 1950s, immigrants flocked to it. Known as the Bracero program, it recruited upward of 450,000 workers a year during the height of that visa&rsquo;s use. The economy of 60 years ago consumed more than seven times the number of legal agricultural migrants than is allowed today.</p>
<p>Immigrants will continue to follow the laws of economics and come to America illegally if a better system is not included in immigration reform. A large scale, lightly regulated, and portable guest worker visa program for all sectors of the economy, modeled on a modified Bracero program, will allow lower-skilled immigrants the option to actually enter lawfully.</p>
<p>The second component of successful reform is fixing immigration enforcement, which would automatically be made more effective and less expensive by completing the first guest worker visa component. By funneling the vast majority of peaceful applicants through a legal channel, immigration enforcement could focus entirely on security and health threats.</p>
<p>In 2012, a net 200,000 unauthorized immigrants settled in the United States. With a large and legal guest worker visa program, there would be no reason for peaceful people to enter illegally. As a result, the number of border-crossers, and those who overstay nonworker visas, would greatly diminish. When the Bracero program was created, illegal border crossings declined by over 90 percent because they were channeled into the legal market.</p>
<p>Any decline close to that of the Bracero program would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to concentrate on finding noncitizens who are violent and property criminals, instead of separating families and raiding American businesses. Every dollar spent by ICE on tracking down otherwise peaceful people should be spent on finding legitimate national security and criminal threats instead.</p>
<p>The third component of successful reform is legalizing at least some of the peaceful unauthorized immigrants already here. This is a difficult but essential portion of reform. Unauthorized immigrants could come forward, pay a fee and a fine, and get checked against criminal and national security systems. If they are peaceful and pay some fines and fees, they should be able to work and live without fearing deportation. A long path to citizenship is preferable, but permanent residency, work authorization and no recourse to welfare benefits are the minimum conditions that should be met.</p>
<p>For immigration reform to be a long-term success, the nature of immigration must be understood. What drives immigrants across international borders is opportunity; a chance for a better life, higher pay and the ability to provide for their families. Immigrants will continue to come for these reasons regardless of stricter enforcement laws or a longer fence. That’s why a legal system made up of the three components laid out above is a system that can really work.</p>
<p>Not only does the political will seem to be present for immigration reform to happen, history proves it can be done in an election year. The last several immigration reforms all happened during election years &mdash; 1986, 1990 and 1996. It can happen again this year. Moreover, if reform focuses on building a workable guest worker program, targeting enforcement to security and health threats and legalizing immigrants already here, 2014’s reform could prove to be the last one for years to come.</p>

<p>President Obama&rsquo;s State of the Union Address is expected to focus heavily on income inequality. Swiping rather liberally from Mayor de Blasio&rsquo;s playbook, the president will likely imply that the reason some Americans are poor is because other Americans are rich.</p>
<p>Such sentiments may play well to the president&rsquo;s base, but in reality, there is no relationship between inequality and poverty. In fact, if we were to double everyone&rsquo;s income tomorrow, millions of Americans would be lifted out of poverty, but inequality would actually increase.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">When it comes to helping the poor, Obama offers nothing but failed policies.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, income inequality has increased in America &mdash; especially during the first five years of the Obama administration. According to a study by Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty, the top 1 percent of earners have captured more of the income gains under Obama than under that champion of the plutocracy George W. Bush.</p>
<p>In part, this is because the president&rsquo;s choices over at the Federal Reserve have pursued an ­easy-money policy that has helped spur speculation and a rising stock market. Since the wealthy are much more heavily invested in the market, its 80 percent-plus rise since 2008 has meant the rich have gotten richer.</p>
<p>And when it comes to helping the poor, Obama offers nothing but failed policies.</p>
<p>For those Americans struggling to find a way out of poverty, few things are more important than a job. In fact, less than 3 percent of Americans who work full-time &mdash; including those in the entry-level, minimum-wage jobs &mdash; live in families with incomes below the poverty level. But the president&rsquo;s policies all too often rip away that first rung on the ladder out of poverty.</p>
<p>Consider some of what President de Blasio &#8230; er, Obama will call for tonight. The centerpiece of his income-equality strategy is likely to be raising the minimum wage. Yet that would actually help few poor people. Research by Joseph Sabia of San Diego State University and Richard Burkhauser of Cornell found that if the federal minimum wage were upped to $9.50 per hour, only 11.3 percent of workers who would gain live in poor households, while more than 42 percent of those who would benefit live in households with incomes above 300 percent of the poverty level. The study also found that state and federal minimum-wage hikes between 2003 and 2007 had no effect on state poverty rates.</p>
<p>While increasing the wages of college students and second earners from middle-class households, Obama&rsquo;s proposal would eliminate many of the entry-level jobs that might start poor Americans on the road out of poverty. As David Neumark and William Wascher reported for the National Bureau of Economic Research, &ldquo;studies that focus on the least-skilled groups provide relatively overwhelming evidence of stronger disemployment effects for these groups&rdquo; from minimum-wage hikes.</p>
<p>Nor should we forget ObamaCare&rsquo;s impact on job-creation. Next year, businesses with more than 50 employees will have to provide health insurance to their workers or pay a $2,000 to $3,000 penalty. For a midsize employer that doesn&rsquo;t offer insurance today, that amounts to more than a $1-per-hour increase in every employee&rsquo;s compensation. Even employers that provide insurance now will find their per-employee costs rising as ObamaCare drives up their premiums and requires that they provide more comprehensive and expensive insurance than they do now.</p>
<p>As a result, businesses are hiring fewer workers; when they do hire, it&rsquo;s more likely to be part-timers. About two-thirds of the jobs created this year have been part-time.</p>
<p>The president, like de Blasio, will also call for more spending on pre-school. This, despite the fact that the government&rsquo;s own studies show that any gains from Head Start and other pre-school programs are minimal and fleeting; gone by the time a child enters third grade.</p>
<p>In short, the president, like the mayor, believes that the pie is essentially fixed and government&rsquo;s job is to divide it up more fairly. But in reality, the pie is infinite.</p>
<p>If President Obama and Mayor de Blasio worried a little less about whether someone somewhere was getting rich, and a little more about how to create prosperity, we might do a much better job of raising Americans out of poverty. If we did that, inequality would take care of itself.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>In combat, John Maynard Keynes often had an edge simply because he had a good feel for the data and a sense of magnitudes. Those who report on economics and finance (among others) could benefit from paying attention to that little Keynesian attribute.</p>
<p>Your report on Argentina&#8217;s most recent economic travails (“<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f42b9c92-8523-11e3-86f7-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk" target="_blank">Currencies hit in wake of Argentina</a>”, January 25) is a case in point. Your reporters note that one of the main causes of Argentina&#8217;s problems is that Buenos Aires “has allowed inflation to reach 25 per cent”. The Johns Hopkins-Cato Institute <a href="http://www.cato.org/research/troubled-currencies-project">Troubled Currencies Project</a>, which I direct, has been producing reliable estimates for Argentina&#8217;s implied annual inflation rate since 2012. Our current estimate is 63 per cent &mdash; more than double the figure reported in the FT.</p>

<p>As President Barack Obama&#8217;s State of the Union address provokes the standard exchange of press releases and talking points, it&#8217;s worth remembering that the partisan foreign policy debate is almost always shallow. The real gap is not between Democratic and Republican leaders but between the political class and the broader public. Consider the Pew Research Center <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/12/03/public-sees-u-s-power-declining-as-support-for-global-engagement-slips/12-3-2013-8" target="_blank">poll</a> late last year that demonstrated that the U.S. public is less interested than the U.S. foreign policy elite in trying to manage foreign affairs. This set off a predictable debate about <a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/14/u-s-isolationism-isnt-protectionism/">whether</a> the <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/foreign-and-defense-policy/are-republicans-really-turning-back-to-isolationism/" target="_blank">public</a> was becoming <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2013/12/10/its-not-isolationist-for-america-to-mind" target="_blank">isolationist</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">The American public, at least in recent memory, has always wanted a more restrained foreign policy than the one on offer from Washington.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But hardly anyone pointed out that the results were nothing new: The American public, at least in recent memory, has always wanted a more restrained foreign policy than the one on offer from Washington. Understanding this gap requires looking beyond the latest election cycle and considering instead the factors that shape the U.S. foreign policy status quo.</p>
<p>The first factor is the public&rsquo;s apathy toward foreign policy. As many studies have shown, people&rsquo;s foreign policy preferences rarely determine their decisions when it comes to national elections. So political leaders &mdash; those in Congress and those vying for the White House &mdash; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paying-Attention-Foreign-Affairs-Presidential/dp/0271037539" target="_blank">can</a> generally buck the public on foreign policy without losing votes. It is not that politicians entirely ignore voters&rsquo; foreign policy views. But, at least compared with tax and entitlement issues, politicians have considerable rope to pursue their own agendas. Only in rare circumstances, such as very unpopular wars, do voters hold politicians to account on foreign policy.</p>
<p>What accounts, in turn, for the low salience of foreign policy? The short answer is that the American public is rich enough and safe enough that it simply need not worry very much about the rest of the world. No state menaces U.S. borders or regularly checks U.S. military actions abroad, as the Soviet Union once did. Trade accords matter a good deal for certain industries, but most of us barely notice them. For the majority of Americans, even the war in Iraq brought little worse than marginally higher tax rates and unsettling TV images. With bigger things to worry about, such as job security and health care, Americans have little incentive to inform themselves about foreign policies; it is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DtGJmgEACAAJ&amp;dq=downs+economic+theory+of+democracy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jRHOUsnLGcS2kQeQrYHoDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6wEwAg" target="_blank">rational</a> for them to remain ignorant.</p>
<p>But the public&rsquo;s disinterest in foreign policy only explains why U.S. political leaders are able to defy public opinion, not why they do so now. In decades past, the U.S. public&rsquo;s noninterventionist sentiment was represented among the foreign policy elite. But these days, the foreign policy establishment consists almost entirely of neoconservatives on the right and liberal internationalists on the left. Realists and other reliable skeptics of intervention are essentially confined to the academy, while true isolationism has become virtually extinct in Washington.</p>
<p>In reality, the United States was relatively isolationist for its first century<strong> </strong>because it had little alternative. The nation was threatened by European powers and too weak to gather an empire. A classically liberal foreign policy ideology &mdash; the idea that overseas alliances and war endangered liberty at home &mdash; made a virtue of that circumstance.</p>
<p>Over the course of the nineteenth century, as the United States expanded economically and territorially as Europe declined, U.S. global ambitions became possible. This initiated a debate among U.S. policymakers about the benefits of pursuing such ambitions. Those who were enticed by the idea of overseas territories or missions continually overstated their benefits by suggesting that democracy and free trade could not thrive, or even survive, if the United States did not act more assertively elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth century, Alfred Thayer Mahan, the U.S. Navy officer and historian, <a href="http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/9246/for-u-s-interventionists-isolationism-is-just-a-dirty-word" target="_blank">coined</a> the term &ldquo;isolationist&rdquo; to denigrate anti-imperialists. He advocated overseas bases as a means to promote the United States&rsquo; values abroad. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson justified U.S. intervention in World War I as a way to make the world safe for democracy. Early cold warriors, such as President Harry Truman&rsquo;s secretary of state, Dean Acheson, redefined the effort to secure Western Europe as a global struggle for freedom and capitalism. By the Cold War&rsquo;s end, realists and other advocates of restraint had been marginalized, despite the fact that their views remained <a href="http://www.danieldrezner.com/research/realist_tradition.pdf" target="_blank">popular</a> among the public; the interventionists, on both the left and right, had successfully established a new elite foreign policy consensus. To this day, anyone seeking prominence as a beltway foreign policy wonk, or a future political appointment, quickly learns that it is necessary to hew to the interventionist conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>The exercise of U.S. power also proved to be self-perpetuating in the sense that it created a relatively small but impassioned constituency with an interest in further military activism (if not necessarily war). The Cold War provided the United States with a permanent set of private military contractors and a vast domestic infrastructure of military bases. Regions that were previously indifferent to foreign events, or even flat-out isolationist, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Rise-Gunbelt-Remapping-Industrial/dp/0195066480" target="_blank">developed</a> a direct economic interest in military manufacturing. Military research funds, which grew massively during the Cold War, also gave a vast group of university researchers and defense analysts an economic interest in defending global activism.</p>
<p>Lately, U.S. policymakers have been migrating toward the broader public&rsquo;s more restrained views on foreign policy. The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have made war more salient for voters, forcing more politicians to <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67681/john-mueller/the-iraq-syndrome-revisited" target="_blank">embrace</a> nonintervention, as the debate over Syria recently demonstrated. The fiscal outlook is another <a href="http://web.mit.edu/ssp/people/williams/Williams_Tobin_paper_102811.pdf" target="_blank">source</a> of restraint. With Democrats eager to defend entitlements and Republicans opposed to tax hikes, the discretionary part of the budget &mdash; more than half of which goes to defense &mdash; will likely have to remain flat, at least for a few years. Democrats&rsquo; defense of other programs will dampen their enthusiasm for military spending. In the Republican Party, meanwhile, military hawks will continue to lose fights against budget hawks.</p>
<p>But this is likely a temporary respite. Eventually, the memory of Iraq and Afghanistan will fade, as that of Vietnam eventually did. And restored economic growth is already limiting the need for hard fiscal choices. Leaders will likely muddle through with the status quo foreign policy and the ideology of global military dominance that sustains it.</p>
<p>For those of us who favor the restrained foreign policy that public opinion would likely produce, that is unfortunate. But it is worth remembering that our overly aggressive foreign policy is a symptom of national health. More tragic wars and economic hardship would likely produce public demand for better foreign policy. But the wealth and safety that allow the U.S. elite to run amok abroad are worth celebrating.</p>

Rahn</p>


<p>The administration and many in Congress seem to have learned nothing from the Obamacare disaster. Now that they have destroyed the world&rsquo;s best health care system, they are in the process of further destroying what was at one time a very functional global financial system.</p>
<p>In its place, they would erect a tax law whose costs were far higher than its benefits; that may drive hundreds of billions of dollars of job-creating foreign capital out of the United States; that could trigger a global financial crisis by driving up interest rates that the U.S. government pays on its bonds; that makes it almost impossible for Americans living abroad to open bank accounts; and that violates international trading agreements that the United States has signed.</p>
<p>The legislation has greatly angered foreign companies and friendly foreign governments such as Canada, because it demands that they report to the Internal Revenue Service, despite being sovereign entities. It is so complex that its implementation has had to be delayed numerous times because Treasury is unable to develop workable compliance systems, and hundreds of thousands of foreign financial firms that are subject to the law also cannot figure out how to comply with ever-changing regulations.</p>
<p>The measure could result in sensitive personal tax and financial data being shared with foreign governments (even untrustworthy and corrupt ones, or worse), and it would violate many privacy laws and regulations and could put innocent people at risk for both their fortunes and lives.</p>
<p>Most Americans have never heard of the law, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which is beginning to cause the damage noted above. In essence, the act would require any financial institution (not just banks) anywhere in the entire world that has any dealings with anyone subject to U.S. tax laws to report to the U.S. government.</p>
<p>How any foreign financial institution could possibly know this in this age of dual citizenships and green cards is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p>
<p>Last week, the Republican National Committee adopted a resolution calling for repeal of the law. Predictably, the Democrats and their big-government allies immediately claimed repeal would facilitate tax evasion &mdash; even though they are unable to design an implementation scheme that would work. This is another example of mindless left-wing ideology over rationality.</p>
<p>The law is now slated to go into effect on July 1, despite the fact that nobody can comply &mdash; neither the governments nor financial institutions. Accordingly, there is talk of another delay, in violation of the law. The Democrats should hope that the law never goes into effect, because the consequences are likely to be so bad that it may even drive the continuing Obamacare disaster off the news pages and cause even more people to vote against them.</p>
<p>The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act is so typical of Washington. Some members of Congress were all worked up about Americans not paying taxes on money they had outside the United States. Rather than come up with a simple solution as most countries have done &mdash; to tax income where it is earned (i.e., a territorial tax system) and not where it resides once it has been originally taxed &mdash; they came up with the incredibly complex compliance act.</p>
<p>It is now obvious, as with Obamacare, that those who proposed and wrote the law had no idea how to design it to make it workable and how to make it compatible with existing U.S. and foreign privacy laws and treaties. Even though it has been three years since the passage of the law, the Treasury has yet to produce a cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>What is known, according to the Congressional Joint Committee of Taxation, is that the law will only produce about $800 million in tax revenue per year, while the compliance costs have been estimated by various parties to run well into the many tens of billions of dollars &mdash; not counting all of the economic damage resulting from reduced investment and job creation, which ultimately could be in the trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>How would most Americans and Congress react if a foreign government passed laws regulating U.S. businesses and people in the United States? Probably with justified outrage. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act is U.S. financial imperialism at its worst and is causing great resentment in much of the world, which is hurting U.S. interests.</p>
<p>Most financial institutions and their knowledgeable customers across the globe are opposed. American Citizens Abroad is persistent in the demand for repeal, because its members have been the first hit. Taxpayer groups, along with tax and financial economists, have expressed strong disapproval of the act and urged its repeal.</p>
<p>Even the former assistant secretary for tax at the U.S. Justice Department, Eileen O&rsquo;Connor, has written a blazing critique of the law, which she ended by stating: &ldquo;The administration&rsquo;s inability to implement the laws Congress passes is a problem. But perhaps a bigger problem is Congress biting off more than the administration can, or ought to, chew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are wise words that the American Founders would have endorsed, which remind us of the importance of limiting the size and scope of government.</p>

<p>My fellow Americans, the State of the Union is &#8230; irrelevant.</p>
<p>Quick: Give me a memorable line from any of President Obama&#8217;s previous five SOTUs. That&#8217;s what I thought. I couldn&#8217;t give you one offhand &mdash; and it&#8217;s my job to watch these pompous, unedifying spectacles and <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/problem-state-union-isnt-seating">write about them</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">In its modern form, the SOTU is a meaningless ritual that rarely even does the president &mdash; let alone the public &mdash; any good.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The few enduring lines from past SOTUs stick out for irony value (Bill Clinton in 1996: &ldquo;the era of big government is over&rdquo;); because they herald a looming policy disaster (George W. Bush in 2002: &ldquo;Axis of Evil&rdquo;) &mdash; or for the rare outbreak of candor (Gerald Ford in 1975: &ldquo;the state of the union is not good&rdquo;).</p>
<p>But most years, the speech gets submerged in the churn of the news cycle, little noted and not long remembered. It&rsquo;s unlikely that 2014 will be any different. In its modern form, the SOTU is a meaningless ritual that rarely even does the president &mdash; let alone the public &mdash; any good.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s bad news for a chief executive whose chief talent is speechifying. &ldquo;I have a gift, Harry,&rdquo; then-Sen. Obama unhumble bragged to Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., some years ago, in the afterglow of a well-received speech. But according to the polling data and the political science research, it&#8217;s a gift that won&#8217;t keep on giving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is overwhelming evidence that presidents, even great communicators,’ rarely move the public in their direction,&rdquo; <a target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2357130">writes George C. Edwards III,</a> a presidential scholar at Texas A&amp;M University. &ldquo;Going public does not work.&rdquo; In a 2013 analysis of SOTU polling, <a target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2357130">Gallup found that</a>&ldquo; most presidents have shown an average <em>decrease</em> in approval of one or more points between the last poll conducted before the State of the Union and the first one conducted afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the speech has become less important, presidents&rsquo; rhetoric has grown more frantically stentorian. Presidential scholar Elvin T. Lim notes &ldquo;increasing rhetorical assertiveness&rdquo; and &ldquo;an increasing lack of humility&rdquo; in the language of the SOTU over time. Modern presidents speak more often of &ldquo;reform,&rdquo; while &ldquo;references to (and hence concern for) the Constitution and constitutional in the annual messages have declined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d hardly imagine it from watching the speech, but the SOTU has constitutional roots, in the duty imposed on the president by Article II, sec. 3: &ldquo;he shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Modern presidents do a lot more hectoring than recommending, treating the SOTU as an occasion to tell Congress what to do. That doesn&#8217;t mean Congress actually does it: The speech is &ldquo;high volume, low yield&rdquo; in terms of legislative success, as a recent Associated Press analysis puts it.</p>
<p>Which, no doubt, is why the administration is signaling that tonight&#8217;s SOTU will be less about telling Congress what to do than it is about telling them what he plans to do without them. This will be &ldquo;a year of action,&rdquo; White House press secretary Jay Carney said Sunday, and the president will &ldquo;bypass Congress where necessary to lift folks who want to come up into the middle class.&rdquo; The White House has hinted at unilateral action on issues like carbon emissions, student loans, and job training. &ldquo;We need to show the American people that we can get something done,&rdquo; says presidential adviser Dan Pfeiffer.</p>
<p>It seems the president plans to go it alone, loudly. But in a recent Christian Science Monitor/TIPP poll, 55 percent of Americans disapproved of presidents &ldquo;taking executive action when Congress is gridlocked.&rdquo; He&#8217;ll have to talk them into liking it.</p>

Dorn</p>


<p>The key question facing policymakers in 2014 will be how to energize the economy and lower the rate of unemployment while avoiding another financial crisis caused by asset price inflation and a misallocation of credit.</p>
<p>The Fed seems concerned with deflation, but the real risk is that the Fed&#8217;s bloated balance sheet, and the extraordinary run-up in the monetary base during the last five years, will begin to show up in inflationary increases in the monetary aggregates.</p>
<p>In an election year, policymakers will be timid in raising interest rates, so the asset bubbles that are becoming more and more obvious could grow larger.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Many of America&#8217;s problems stem from intrusive government, not from genuine free markets.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But no one expects another 26% gain in stock prices. When, not if, longer-term rates rise, the bubbles will deflate.</p>
<p>If the Fed tries to inject funds to forestall the downturn, general inflation could occur, along with a rise in unemployment. Stagflation is more probable than deflation.</p>
<p>From a more fundamental viewpoint, the outlook for the U.S. economy depends on whether policy decisions are supportive of economic freedom. Policies that are consistent with the primacy of the market and limited government will allow individuals to pursue their happiness &mdash; and the wealth of the nation will grow along with opportunities for exchange.</p>
<p>The economy is a complex system that cannot be fine-tuned by government. However, sound economic policies can provide a stable institutional framework for markets to create wealth.</p>
<p>Long-term rules that provide for the maximum economic freedom under a rule of law protecting people&#8217;s rights to own property, trade, and reap the rewards (or bear the costs) of those trades will bring about economic and social harmony.</p>
<p>When government interferes with those rights, undermines the rule of law, and fails to ensure sound money and fiscal rectitude, special interests will trump limited government.</p>
<p>The result will be bigger government, a loss of economic freedom, and disharmony as groups vie for a larger slice of a slowing economy.</p>
<p>The sharp increase in the size and scope of government since the financial crisis has significantly reduced economic freedom.</p>
<p>For two decades (1980&ndash;2000), the U.S. was consistently in the top tier of economically free countries, ranking second in 2000 (using the Economic Freedom of the World chain-linked index, published by the Fraser Institute along with the Cato Institute and a number of other think tanks).</p>
<p>By 2011, the U.S. had dropped to 19th place in the world rankings. Hong Kong remains No. 1.</p>
<p>In order for the U.S. to regain its top-tier ranking, there must be a depoliticization of economic life and a move toward policies that enhance market liberalism.</p>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies, especially since the Great Recession, has made private economic decision-making more difficult and harmed economic growth.</p>
<p>Monetary policy has become a major instrument of fiscal policy and, like fiscal policy, has no long-term rules to guide decisions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the thousands of pages of new regulations spawned by Dodd-Frank, the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare), and numerous other statutes hamper competition, innovation and employment.</p>
<p>Highly unconventional monetary policy since the Panic of 2008 has greatly expanded the Fed&#8217;s power, distorted interest rates, misallocated credit, and made the Fed the largest buyer of government debt.</p>
<p>The Fed has kept inflation low by paying interest on banks’ excess reserves, thus sterilizing much of the increase in base money created by its asset purchases.</p>
<p>That policy, along with ultra-low interest rates, has made banks reluctant to lend to small businesses already burdened with high taxes and costly regulations &mdash; all of which slow investment and job growth.</p>
<p>The manipulation of interest rates &mdash; holding real rates near zero or even negative &mdash; has depleted savings, increased risk-taking and inflated asset prices. The Fed is engaged in credit and fiscal policy, not pure monetary policy (money growth has been relatively slow).</p>
<p>There is strong political pressure for the Fed to continue holding short-term interest rates near zero. It will be harder to control long-term rates, especially as the Fed reduces its bond-buying program. As rates rise, holders of Treasuries and MBS will suffer capital losses. These include the Fed itself and foreign central banks.</p>
<p>Thus, the Fed under Janet Yellen will have to face some difficult choices. If rates rise too fast, the U.S. economy will slow; if they rise too slowly, inflation expectations will rise.</p>
<p>Also, fiscal deficits will be greatly affected by the Fed&#8217;s interest-rate policy: Higher rates will significantly increase the cost of funding federal deficit spending as well as servicing the existing debt.</p>
<p>Yet, the longer the Fed adheres to financial repression, the more costly it will become to reverse course and normalize its balance sheet.</p>
<p>If long-term rates do increase in 2014, there will be pressure on Congress to cut the deficit, rein in entitlement spending, and start thinking about tax reform.</p>
<p>Cutting the high U.S. corporate income tax rate would spur investment and make the transition to a more orthodox monetary policy smoother.</p>
<p>The Fed must satisfy the dual mandate of price stability and full employment. The problem is that monetary policy is limited: Printing money cannot spur real economic growth, but it can cause inflation and higher unemployment, as in the stagflation of the 1970s.</p>
<p>There is legislation before Congress to move to a single mandate and require the Fed to focus on long-term price stability. There is also a move by Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, to create a Centennial Monetary Commission to evaluate the Federal Reserve&#8217;s first 100 years and examine alternatives to the current discretionary government fiat money regime.</p>
<p>Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has also announced a major effort to hold the Fed accountable and to conduct hearings in 2014 on the Fed&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>Yellen, an experienced policymaker, has said she will continue with Bernanke&#8217;s low-interest rate policy while winding down QE.</p>
<p>She expects that by keeping short-term rates low for the foreseeable future, long-term rates will be constrained, even after QE tapering begins.</p>
<p>That assumption is questionable. Moreover, according to Stanley Fischer, who is likely to become the Fed&#8217;s vice chairman: “You can&#8217;t expect the Fed to spell out what it&#8217;s going to do, because it doesn&#8217;t know.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the problem with a pure discretionary fiat money regime is that it is short-term-oriented and subject to intense politicization.</p>
<p>Today, there is no monetary rule to anchor expectations and the price level. In a democracy, politicians are myopic; they respond to special interests and have an incentive to get elected.</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution narrowly defines the powers of the federal government, but that has not prevented the vast expansion of the state.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in 2014 and beyond will be to recognize the limits of government &mdash; especially the limits of monetary policy to stimulate the real economy &mdash; and to restore economic freedom so individuals can innovate and prosper.</p>
<p>Many of America&#8217;s problems stem from intrusive government, not from genuine free markets. Government has an important role to play in a free society, but one limited by the rights of individuals.</p>
<p>The outlook for 2014 and beyond will depend on whether the rule of law and limited government prevail or whether special interests and “democracy” trump what F.A. Hayek called the “constitution of liberty.”</p>
<p>The midterm election will provide a referendum on that historic question.</p>

<p>Egypt is racing toward dictatorship. Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sisi even arrested opponents of the proposed constitution in the January referendum. However, Washington always has been more interested in maintaining influence than encouraging democracy or promoting development in Egypt. Toward that end the U.S. provided more than $75 billion in &ldquo;aid&rdquo; over the years. In fact, the cash bought little leverage. Hosni Mubarak spent decades oppressing Egyptian citizens and persecuting Coptic Christians despite Washington&rsquo;s advice to the contrary. Israel&rsquo;s military superiority, not America&rsquo;s money, bought peace. Cash for fancy weapons may have won privileged access to Egyptian airspace and the Suez Canal, but today the Egyptian military needs the U.S.&mdash;for maintenance on and spare parts for those same weapons&mdash;more than the U.S. needs the Egyptian military.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote right">
 <p class="pq-quote"><span class="open-quote">&ldquo;</span><span class="pq-body">Washington should set aside political differences and propose that the two governments free up investment and trade.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, as elsewhere in the Third World, foreign &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; actually hindered economic development, effectively subsidizing Cairo&rsquo;s inefficient dirigiste policies. Most undeveloped rural states attempted state-led development strategies to modernize, with disastrous results. Yet access to foreign cash reduced pressure to make politically painful economic reforms. So it was in Egypt. As long as enough money was available to pay off important interest groups, most notably the military, even a dictator like Mubarak saw no reason to risk political unrest.</p>
<p>A decade ago the government finally recognized the need to open the economy. Rebecca Nelson and Jeremy Sharp of the Congressional Research Service reported on &ldquo;wide-ranging structural reforms, including tariff reductions, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reductions in regulation of the private sector, among other policy measures, that aimed to improve the business environment and make Egypt&rsquo;s economy more competitive.&rdquo; Meredith Broadbent of the Center for Strategic and International Studies cited corporate tax reductions and insurance regulation modernization. The result was international recognition for Cairo&rsquo;s efforts, increased foreign investment, and increased economic growth.</p>
<p>However, Egypt then began to fall behind other reformers. According to the Economic Freedom of the World index, Egypt <a href="http://www.freetheworld.com/countrydata.php?country=C39" target="_blank">ranked</a> 53 of 123 in 2000, fell to 94 of 127 in 2003, rose to 78 of 141 in 2007, and then fell back to 99 of 144 in 2010. Important problems remained. For instance, Broadbent pointed to the survival of &ldquo;significant elements of a heavy-handed statist bureaucracy.&rdquo; The banking system was opaque, monopolistic and inaccessible. A joint report by the Carnegie Endowment and Legatum Institute pointed to the need to give poor Egyptians clear title to their property, reform the bankruptcy law, and reduce costs of opening, operating and closing businesses.</p>
<p>Corruption was pervasive: Transparency International ranked Egypt at 114 out of 171 countries in 2013. Writing for the Carnegie Middle East Center last June, Ibrahim Saif and Ahmed Ghoneim cited as problem areas &ldquo;allocations of land, freezing of anti-trust laws, and dubious privatization deals.&rdquo; They set forth a reform program based on more reliable policies and regulations, minimal intervention in the credit markets, greater transparency in public finance and military economic activities, and reform of investment policy, along with political and judicial improvements.</p>
<p>The economy remained dominated by cronyism and privilege. The military controls anywhere between 15 percent and 40 percent of the economy. Other influential individuals and interests also benefit from state favors. Saif and Ghoneim observed that larger private firms &ldquo;have disproportionate access to decision makers and may be skewing policy in their direction.&rdquo; In fact, members of the business elite are suspected of having helped orchestrate artificial shortages to intensify public dissatisfaction with President Mohammed Morsi in order to help justify a coup.</p>
<p>The most serious economic hindrance was extensive and expensive consumer subsidies, particularly for food and fuel. Most of the benefits did not go to those in most need. Alas, explained my Cato Institute colleague Dalibor Rohac: &ldquo;Not only are subsidies highly ineffective in helping the poor, they are also an increasingly unsustainable drain on the country&rsquo;s public finances and its foreign reserves.&rdquo; The cost accounts for roughly a third of the government&rsquo;s budget and 14 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Thus, even after the Mubarak reforms unemployment and inflation remained high while Cairo ran large deficits. The benefits of reform failed to reach many people, especially the extreme poor. The situation worsened after the 2011 revolution.</p>
<p>The Morsi government cut gasoline subsidies and raised taxes, only to reverse course under public fire. Cairo also hiked government employment and salaries. The public deficit increased to 11 percent of GDP. Worse was the business environment. Observed Nelson and Sharp: &ldquo;Continued insecurity stemming from deterioration in law and order has hampered investment.&rdquo; Other analysts pointed to the lack of certainty of even the direction of policy.</p>
<p>The coup was another large step backwards. The government is focused on suppressing the Brotherhood and any other opposition, as well as reconstituting the &ldquo;deep state&rdquo; and old political and economic relationships. Indeed, Gen. al-Sisi appears to be determined on a return to &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; Reported the <em>Washington Post</em>: &ldquo;now some businessmen and officials implicated in post-uprising corruption probes are again in positions of power and influence, including in the cabinet appointed last summer by the military.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor is Gen. al-Sisi likely to court unpopularity by adopting tough reforms. The prime minister said the government plans to &ldquo;rationalize&rdquo; the subsidy, but economic reform appears to be a low priority. Finance Minister Ahmed Galal said he hopes to find more outside money to spend on &ldquo;public investment&rdquo; and &ldquo;to bring about greater equality.&rdquo; In September the regime launched a &ldquo;$4.2 billion program for &ldquo;economic development and social justice,&rdquo; but big spending initiatives elsewhere have not ended well. The government also intends to introduce a public sector minimum wage this year, which will hike state costs and, businesses worry, might eventually be extended to the private sector.</p>
<p>Military rule could offer a form of stability. However, Gen. al-Sisi&rsquo;s brutality, including the slaughter of Brotherhood protesters in Cairo in August, has encouraged increasingly violent opposition. Policemen are regularly being killed, and both auto and suicide bombings are on the rise. During the 1990s when the Brotherhood was similarly banned some members conducted a campaign of low-level terrorism.</p>
<p>Even sporadic violence, especially if targeting foreigners, could frighten off investors and tourists. Although a number of American firms say they are staying, greater uncertainty in Egypt is one reason Apache Corp. of Houston, the largest U.S. investor in Egypt, sold off a third of its oil stake to China&rsquo;s Sinopec. Chevron has divested its gas station network.</p>
<p>In this environment American financial assistance would be even more harmful than before.</p>
<p>The massive aid coming from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states&mdash;given purely for the political purpose of combating the Muslim Brotherhood&mdash;reduces any financial pressure on the regime to streamline economic policy. Unfortunately, reported the <em>Financial Times</em>: &ldquo;Another concern, voiced by business and economists, is that the recent easing of Egypt&rsquo;s economic predicament thanks to largesse from oil-rich Gulf countries, may result in an indefinite deferral of painful but much-needed structural reforms.&rdquo; More checks from Washington would make the government even less likely to enact those reforms.</p>
<p>While more government-to-government aid to Gen. al-Sisi&rsquo;s burgeoning pharaonic state would be counterproductive, freer trade would be a positive good. Encouraging greater commerce among nations would naturally increase the demand for Egyptian products and services. Instead of offering artificial subsidies, lower trade barriers would improve the natural reward for an entrepreneurial population.</p>
<p>Two years ago Meredith Broadbent proposed negotiating a free-trade agreement&mdash;previous talks left off in 2005&mdash;and updating the bilateral investment treaty, probably the easier and quicker task. The Carnegie-Legatum study suggested as a second best creating &ldquo;qualifying Industrial Zones&mdash;especially in the underdeveloped areas of Upper Egypt.&rdquo; The point is not to boost whoever happens to be ruling the country at the time. Rather, an FTA would aid entrepreneurs and their workers, who would be the ones taking advantage of increased access to the American market. Nine years ago the Institute for International Economics projected that an FTA would increase Egypt&rsquo;s GDP by three percent annually.</p>
<p>Broadbent pointed out that a new accord also would benefit U.S. firms, which have been left at a disadvantage by the EU-Egyptian FTA. Today America&rsquo;s top exports to Egypt are agriculture, electronics and machinery, metals, and chemicals. FTAs, she argued, &ldquo;can serve as systemic tools to help pry open closed government regulatory processes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Egypt&rsquo;s problems are many, serious, and deep. Absent an inclusive political process, the country likely faces an unstable and violent future. However, even wise political leadership, so far lacking in Gen. al-Sisi&rsquo;s course, is not enough.</p>
<p>Economic reform also is necessary. That is unlikely to come from lectures and money from foreign governments. But the prospect of increased participation in international commerce would offer a far more powerful and direct incentive for action. Washington should set aside political differences and propose that the two governments free up investment and trade.</p>
