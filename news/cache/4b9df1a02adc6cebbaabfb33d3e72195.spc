        With national student loan debt topping $1 trillion last year, it 
seems the problem has never been more universal in reach. For proof, look no further than the U.S. 
Capitol. Sure, a majority of lawmakers are millionaires, but that doesn't mean they're exempt from repaying loans taken out to cope with expensive tuition bills.&nbsp;
Forty-one members of Congress -- three senators and 38 House members -- reported student loan debt in 2012, our most
 recent data shows.&nbsp;And it's something that knows no party allegiance. Floor debates about education policy can become 
bitterly partisan, but student debtors were split almost evenly in 2012 -- 29 Democrats and 25 Republicans owe.

        After the interest rate on student loan debt doubled on July 1, 2013, Democrats in the Senate and House Republicans diverged on how to address 
it. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed fixing the interest on student loans at the low rates at which banks borrow from Federal Reserve. House Republicans like Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), meanwhile, pushed to implement caps on student loans at slightly higher rates.But Warren and McMorris Rodgers come at the problem from a common place: they each owe money on student loans, according to their personal financial disclosure statements. Warren is in debt to Harvard University for between $15,001 and $50,000, while McMorris Rodgers owes between $10,001 and $15,000 to to ACS Education Services, Inc.Rep. Mark Takano, who was elected in 2012, still owes about $30,000 on loans he used to finance his masters degree from the University of California, Riverside. "Taking out unsubsidized student loans made me more sensitive to the choices available to young people, as well as older people looking to retrain and advance their skills," Takano said in an interview with OpenSecrets Blog. He said his years teaching high school seniors in public schools and his position as a trustee of Riverside Community College also shaped his approach to higher education policy. "I'm a defender of student aid in the form of grants and subsidized loans."Reps.&nbsp;Michael Turner&nbsp;(R-Ohio) and&nbsp;John Shimkus&nbsp;(R-Ill.) both turned up on our list for the first time, though they have been in Congress for years. Both&nbsp;Turner and Shimkus have both been in Congress for many sessions, but took out loans for their children in 2012. Overall, 17 members of Congress listed loans for a spouse or child. The largest amount owed on a loan benefiting a child in 2012 belonged to Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.). "Two students in school equals twice the tuition bills. With college costs hitting astronomical highs, it won't be easy on us," Israel wrote in an op-ed for the Huffington Post, in which he called for a tax subsidy for middle class families with kids in college.Warren, like Israel, is grappling with student loan policy on behalf of her constituents while striving to pay down her own student loans. Last August, Warren excoriated Sallie Mae -- the nation's largest provider and servicer of student loans -- for acting "unfairly or deceptively" in its lending to active-duty servicemen. Eighteen of her colleagues -- Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) and 17 members of the House -- owe money to Sallie Mae.Meanwhile, seven members of Congress fell off of our tally sheet entirely in 2012: Reps. John Conyers, Jr., Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.),&nbsp; Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) and&nbsp; Marc Veasey (D-Texas).The shuffling ushered five House members into the top 10 owing the most on student loans for the first time: Reps. Israel, Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), Sean Duffy&nbsp;(R-Wis.) and Joe Heck&nbsp;(R-Nev). Altogether, the 10 largest student loan debts in Congress amounted to nearly $1.8 million in 2012, 15 percent less than the previous year's sum of close to $2.1 million.Image: Tulane University (Flickr/wallyg)Follow Emily on Twitter: @emilyakopp

        Facebook just turned 10. The little social media site that could, started by Harvard undergrads as a platform for college classmates to connect, has now expanded into a publicly traded global empire with new features and app updates debuting all the time, giving founder Mark Zuckerberg a net worth of over $3.7 billion.Though it only recently jumped into the Washington game, Facebook has made a huge splash in the past few years - and it shows no sign of stopping. In 2012, political contributions from Facebook to candidates increased more than eightfold over their 2008 level, fueled in part by the political action committee the company established in 2011 (prior to that, its giving came only from employees). Moreover, while overall spending on lobbying has been steadily declining for years now, Facebook has gone in the opposite direction, ramping up its lobbying expenditures every year since it entered the Beltway in 2009.By the numbers, Facebook's lobbying doesn't particularly stand out compared to that of other tech giants like Google. But Facebook has been among the first to the front lines on many hot-button legislative issues in recent years, such as Internet surveillance and immigration. In one prominent political foray, Zuckerberg partnered with a number of entrepreneurs to form FWD.us, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that launched in April 2013 to drive action on immigration reform -- and spent $600,000 on lobbying in its first year alone.
        While the social media giant may not be the biggest political spender from the technology sector, the company and its principles have learned the lessons of their predecessors. Microsoft Corp., formed in 1975, is notorious for being a late bloomer in the political world. The company didn't put serious thought into its Washington operation until the late 1990s, and by that time, it had already run afoul of the U.S. government, which accused it of antitrust violations in United States v. Microsoft Corp. Facebook's political contributions have so far been split pretty evenly between Republican and Democratic candidates -- though it appears to be parting with that giving pattern in 2014. In the 2012 election cycle, Facebook's PAC made its debut by distributing $54,000 among Democrats and $78,500 among Republicans in the House, and $71,000 to Democrats and $65,000 to Republicans in the Senate. Though it's almost too early to tell, Facebook's 2014 contributions appear to be skewing increasingly rightward -- so far, the PAC has given $12,000 to Democrats and $23,000 to Republicans in the House, and $18,500 to Democrats and $24,000 to Republicans in the Senate. Donations by Facebook employees and their spouses in the 2008 election cycle clearly favored Democrats: Of the $79,305 doled out, 99 percent went to Democratic candidates. But in the 2012 cycle, the total surged to $361,000, with 65 percent going to Democrats and 35 percent to Republicans. In 2014, however, these contributors are increasingly following the pattern of Facebook's PAC -- so far in this election cycle, it's more of an even split, with 57% going to Democrats and 43% going to Republicans. Even though Facebook still contributes only a fraction of what Microsoft spends on political giving, it's quickly catching up on the lobbying front -- Facebook spent $6.3 million on federal lobbying in 2013 compared to Microsoft's $10.5 million. In 2013, Facebook's top issue was immigration, followed closely by computers and information technology, then taxes. In addition, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has strategically "leaned in" to a series of high-profile political meetings. Sandberg angled for quality time with former Sen. Max Baucus at the Montana Economic Development Summit last September, likely to discuss tax reform. She also scored a prime seat at a December gathering of Silicon Valley executives that met to troubleshoot with President Obama about the problem-plagued rollout of Healthcare.gov. With 1.23 billion monthly active users, 6 billion likes per day, and 7.8 trillion messages sent on its platform, Facebook undoubtedly has the capacity to carry a big stick in Washington's inner circles. It shows no signs of decelerating the expansion of its political capital in its next 10 years.Doug Weber contributed research to this post.Follow Sarah: @sflockenFollow Rory: @RorySlatkoImage: AP Photo/Martin Sterba

        The Olympics has seen its share of sketchy financial maneuvering in the recent past, from the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic bribery scandal to the alleged corruption surrounding this year's games in Sochi. But with the curtain about to go up on the opening ceremonies and some team and qualifying events in the 22nd edition of the winter games, it naturally occurred to us to wonder how the U.S. Olympic Committee invests its money -- perfectly legally -- in Washington. Politics and sports, after all, aren't mutually exclusive.Traditionally, the U.S. Olympic Committee didn't spend much on lobbying, only once breaking $250,000 before 2007. But that year, it crept up to $280,000, and by 2009 it had spiked to $475,000. It has dropped back a bit, as has the lobbying spending of most entities, but in 2013 the committee still spent $360,000.&nbsp; Many of the committee's most-lobbied issues have to do with sports, athletics, travel and tourism, which appeared on a combined 23 of the committee's disclosure reports over the past two years. But surprisingly, the No. 1 issue the committee lobbied on over the past two years was veterans' affairs, which appeared on its disclosure reports 23 times. 
        The reason? The USOC uses much of its lobbying power to push for increased funding for the Paralympic Games, the separate, Olympics-style competition for athletes with disabilities. The USOC and the Department of Veterans Affairs have frequently worked together to train vets for the Paralympics through a variety of programs, most notably the Veteran Athlete Training Allowance, which gives out $2 million annually to help condition disabled veterans for a spot in the games. Other training programs, like the U.S. Paralympic and Military Veterans Program, have been funded through defense bills like the National Defense Authorization Act. The committee lobbied hard on that bill in 2012, listing it four times in its disclosure reports.&nbsp;Candidate fundingAs we detailed in&nbsp;our story&nbsp;on the 2012 London Olympic Games, individual members of the United States Olympic Committee's board of directors have long been active in the political sphere. In the 2012 and 2014 election cycles (so far), six of the board's 15 members have donated a total of nearly $225,000 to political candidates, committees and organizations.&nbsp;Seventy percent of the cash that went to candidates or party committees went to Republicans.&nbsp;That rightward lean is heavily influenced by James Easton, former owner and chairman of Easton Sports. In the 2012 and 2014 campaign cycles, Easton has donated $122,000 to Republican organizations, PACs and candidates, including $44,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, $32,400 to the National Republican Congressional Committee and $5,000 to 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. His other gifts in the last cycle and the current one have gone to Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), Republican congressional candidates Gary Delong and Tony Strickland, both Californians -- and to one Democrat, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska.On the other side of the political spectrum is board member Ursula Burns, the chairman and CEO of Xerox Corp. Burns donated nearly $54,000 to political candidates and organizations in the 2012 election cycle, with nearly $38,000 of that total split among Democratic committees in the swing states of Wisconsin, Virginia, New Hampshire, Iowa, Ohio, Florida, Nevada and Colorado. Burns gave another $6,400 to Xerox's political action committee, with the rest of her contributions going to candidates: $2,500 to President Barack Obama, $5,000 to Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and $2,400 to one Republican, as well: Rep.Tom Reed (R-N.Y.). (Burns made no contributions in the current cycle through the first three-quarters of 2013.)Burns isn't alone in giving to Democrats. Anita DeFrantz, a member of the International Olympic Committee and vice president of the International Rowing Federation, split up her political donations in the 2012 cycle between Obama and Democratic organizations. DeFrantz gave $5,000 to Obama during the cycle, with another $6,000 going to the Democratic National Committee&nbsp;and $500 to PAC for a Change, a political action committee affiliated with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). Thus far in the 2014 cycle, DeFrantz has given $250 to Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.).Dave Ogrean, the executive director of USA Hockey, has also proven to be a reliable Democratic backer over the past few years. In the 2012 race, Ogrean primarily gave to Democratic senators in tight races: $250 to Sen. Mark Udall (D-Col.) and $500 each to Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.). Ogrean also contributed $250 to GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, but when it came time for the general election, he switched back over to the Democratic side, donating $950 to Obama.Other politically active board members include Discovery Communications founder John S. Hendricks and James Benson of investment company Benson Botsford LLC. Hendricks gave $5,000 to Romney in the 2012 election, while Benson has donated to a range of Republican candidates, including $3,000 to Romney, $2,000 to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and $5,000 to former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown.&nbsp;The U.S. Olympic Committee's Executive Team has been politically active as well, but at a much lower level than its board. Since 2010, only two members of the 16-person executive team have donated money to political candidates. Lisa Baird,&nbsp;the USOC's Chief Marketing Officer, donated $500 in 2013 to Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.). Meanwhile, CFO Walter Glover has been a strong Obama supporter, giving $1,200 to the president's 2012 campaign. That's in addition to $1,250 Glover donated to his 2008 campaign.&nbsp;Follow Robbie on Twitter at @robbiefeinberg

        Pick a large American company, and it's a pretty safe bet that you've just named a firm that's well-represented in Washington. Virtually every industry leader has a political action committee and a few of the best lobbyists money can buy.Of course, some industries invest much more in D.C. than others. Even within industries, firms vary greatly in their spending on campaign contributions and lobbying, whether due to factors specific to their line of work, the ideological tendencies of their management, or any number of other reasons. And some of the country's biggest firms choose not to play the game at all.Which are the largest companies, using the most recent Fortune 500 rankings, with little or no track record of federal political spending? Since foreign corporations can't establish federal PACs, we'll limit this analysis to domestic companies. (U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations, however, can have PACs. In fact, the world's largest corporation, Royal Dutch Shell, is connected to a PAC through its subsidiary Shell Oil.) 
        Technically, the largest firm without a PAC in its own name is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. This may sound surprising, given that Buffett, who hails from Nebraska, is hardly an unfamiliar face
 in Washington. However, several of Berkshire Hathaway's subsidiaries 
have PACs of their own, which in combination are large enough that 
Berkshire Hathaway is actually one of the 20 biggest sources of PAC funds to Republican candidates this cycle.Excluding Buffett's umbrella corporation, the largest company without a PAC is an even more familiar name: Apple. While the high-tech industry's presence in Washington
 hasn't always grown apace with its economic importance, Apple's 
footprint in D.C. is small even in the tech world. Google, which didn't 
crack Fortune's top 50 in revenue, has both a PAC and a lobbying budget that was nearly 10 times the size of Apple's in 2012.On
 the subject of lobbying, what's the largest U.S. company with no 
history of lobbying the federal government? The answer is a little 
farther down Fortune's list, but still in the top 25 in revenue: Costco.
 With just under $100 billion in revenue, Costco is one of the country's
 biggest retailers, but eschews lobbying despite having a CEO who makes no secret of his political opinions. Outside the Beltway, however, Costco has occasionally thrown its money around, spending more than $20 million on a successful ballot initiative to allow privately-owned retailers to sell alcohol in Washington State.Revenue
 is only one way to measure a corporation's size, and doesn't always 
correspond to intuitions about which companies are the "biggest"; 
McDonald's, for example, isn't among Fortune's top 100. What if we 
rank companies by number of employees instead? Again excluding Berkshire
 Hathaway, the largest corporation with no PAC is TJX, the 
Massachusetts-based parent of both TJ Maxx and Marshalls. With 179,000 
employees, perhaps TJX feels confident that being a major employer in 
many districts will ensure that elected officials give it all the 
attention it needs. As it happens, the top employer with no history of 
lobbying is another clothing retailer: Macy's Inc, just a few thousand employees smaller than TJX.A
 final caveat: there are many strategies for winning friends and 
influencing people in Washington, and not all of them have to be 
disclosed. Given the growing popularity of alternatives to formal lobbying, for example, it's always possible that companies like Costco and Macy's are protecting their interests in other ways.Image: Warren Buffett in 2013 (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)

        Contested primaries again will be critical harbingers of the 2014 mid-term election results. They'll be watched especially closely on the Republican side, where unexpected nominees have been blamed, at least in part, for Republicans' failure to take control of the Senate in recent elections. Surprise GOP primary winners in Nevada (Sharron Angle), Delaware (Christine O'Donnell), Indiana (Richard Mourdock), Missouri (Todd Akin) and Colorado (Ken Buck) over the last two cycles may have cost the party seats critical to gaining a majority. Other non-establishment winners who went on to victory in Texas (Ted Cruz), Kentucky (Rand Paul) and Utah (Mike Lee) have affected the ideological makeup of the Republican caucus.&nbsp; On the Democratic side, 2010 primary challenges to Senate candidates in Arkansas (incumbent Blanche Lincoln) and Pennsylvania (Joe Sestak) were beaten back, but signaled weakness -- both Lincoln and Sestak lost their general election fights. In the House, increased polarization among lawmakers and the electorate, paired with the creation of homogenous districts across the country, have led to nearly all districts being "safe" for one party.&nbsp; Most of the potential for ousting incumbents comes in primaries or those few competitive districts that remain. &nbsp;The number of primary contests since 2004 in which the incumbent received less than 70 percent of the vote has grown substantially for House candidates, from 15 in that cycle to 34 in 2012 (a slight drop from 40 in 2010). The increase has been more pronounced among Republicans, where different elements of the party are competing for control, though the numbers grew for Democrats, too, before falling dramatically in the 2012 cycle. In the Senate, the number bumped up for a few cycles but fell back down to two in 2012. Here's a breakdown:Incumbents Who Received Less Than 70 Percent of the Vote {"dataSourceUrl":"//docs.google.com/a/crp.org/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AtkPHD2bTUzbdDJWQTYzdDRrN3BvOE8wYWV1R0hPX0E&transpose=0&headers=0&range=A2%3AF6&gid=0&pub=1","options":{"vAxes":[{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindow":{"max":null,"min":null},"maxValue":null},{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindow":{"max":null,"min":null},"maxValue":null}],"titleTextStyle":{"fontSize":16},"sortColumn":null,"booleanRole":"certainty","title":"Chart title","height":200,"legend":"right","width":600,"hAxis":{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindow":{"max":null,"min":null},"maxValue":null},"animation":{"duration":500},"focusTarget":"series","tooltip":{"trigger":"none"}},"state":{},"view":{},"isDefaultVisualization":false,"chartType":"Table","chartName":"Chart 1"} What's behind this? One factor widely noted is the growth of outside spending groups. The numbers show a somewhat greater likelihood that a member would be challenged from within her own party after a series of court decisions, beginning in 2008, freed outside groups to spend much more aggressively in electoral efforts. 
        So is this all about outside groups pulling the parties apart from 
within? Should we expect these groups to participate more, and in a 
more sophisticated way, in 2014 primaries? &nbsp;It
 isn't as though primary challenges never happened in the days before 
Citizens United and the other court and regulatory actions that have 
reshaped national politics in the last few years.&nbsp; Two races from 2006 
are good examples. In Connecticut, Sen. Joe Lieberman
 sought reelection to the Senate after his high-profile support of 
President Bush's efforts in Iraq. He was challenged in the Democratic 
primary by Ned Lamont, whose stated policies were much more in line with national party goals.The
 Lamont campaign was driven financially by two forces: a new grassroots 
effort to encourage small contributions from a national network of 
donors (ActBlue),
 and the candidate's own resources. Lamont was able to start his 
campaign late, by current standards, with his first campaign finance 
report covering the first quarter of 2006, only four months prior to the
 first "voting" in the party convention in Connecticut. About half of 
his early fundraising (roughly $370,000 in that first quarterly report) 
came from his own bank account. Nearly half of the remaining money 
came in contributions from individuals, and more than half of that 
(about $161,000) was in the form of small donations of $200 or less. That was unusual: Most candidates in statewide races begin by seeking 
contributions at the upper end of the limit from people they know 
through business or political experience.&nbsp; Much of the small 
dollar fundraising was attributed to ActBlue, at that time a relatively 
new organization designed to inform and mobilize such donors throughout 
the country. ActBlue provides progressive voters and activists with 
information about candidates and an easy way to offer "earmarked" 
contributions to those it favors. Its off-year fundraising and 
earmarking has grown steadily from about $1.5 million in 2005 to more 
than $66 million in 2013 alone.&nbsp; The Lamont campaign - an anti-war 
challenge to an incumbent who was perceived by many Democrats as a 
traitor to the party - was a perfect fit for the organization and its 
liberal supporters. During the first three months of 2006, ActBlue was 
responsible for funneling $118,000 in small donations to Lamont. Over 
the course of the race, ActBlue sent about $400,000 altogether to 
Lamont, or a little more than 10 percent of all his contributions from 
individuals. &nbsp;Still, that total would not be nearly enough to 
conduct a competitive campaign, especially in an expensive media state 
like Connecticut. The most important financial force in the Lamont 
effort was his own checkbook. Lamont himself funded about $17 million of
 the $20.6 million total he spent during the primary and general 
election campaigns. &nbsp;In the end, while Lamont defeated Lieberman
 in the Democratic primary contest, the incumbent was able to build a 
successful independent campaign in the general election.Republicans
 had a nearly mirror image intra-party Senate battle in neighboring 
Rhode Island the same year. Liberal Republican incumbent Sen. Lincoln Chafee was challenged from the right by Steve Laffey, a conservative former investment banker.As
 with Lamont, Laffey's finances were buttressed by his own resources 
plus a national network of contributions organized by an outside group. In the third quarter of 2005 Laffey looked like a typical challenger, 
with about half his funds coming from individuals, many of them from the
 financial industry, and the other half coming from his personal funds 
in the form of a loan. In the last three months of 2005, though, things
 shifted. Nearly half of his contributions from individuals (about 
$140,000) were earmarked through the Club for Growth, a conservative organization with both an active PAC and an earmarking program similar to ActBlue. &nbsp;In
 all, Club for Growth would provide more than $500,000 in earmarked 
donations, or about one-third of the money Laffey raised from 
individuals. &nbsp;Chafee defeated Laffey in the primary, 54 to 46 percent, but he was beaten by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse in the general election.Shifting TerrainThe
 first of the major court decisions that have changed the way campaigns 
are funded and conducted came in 2007. The ruling in Wisconsin Right to 
Life v. FEC allowed nonprofit groups to spend money more directly in 
elections, making reference to candidates in broadcast ads just before 
elections so long as the ads were about legislative issues. This 
flexibility in direct spending advanced with the 2010 decisions in 
Citizens United v. FEC and SpeechNow v. FEC, which allowed corporations 
(including nonprofits) and unions to spend unlimited amounts directly 
supporting or opposing candidates, and confirmed that political 
committees that exclusively made these independent expenditures could 
also use unlimited and unrestricted contributions for these purposes.In
 primaries since then, challengers showed some of the same fundraising 
patterns as Lamont and Laffey, but there were differences as well:&nbsp; The 
candidates themselves in the later races (e.g. Joe Miller in Alaska, Bill Halter in Arkansas, Sestak in Pennslyvania, and Lee in Utah in 2010
 or Mourdock in 2012) often raised significant amounts in small 
donations from individuals, grew national fundraising bases and were 
helped by outside organizations. ActBlue was an important factor for the
 successful Democratic challengers, for example, with Sestak receiving 
more than $3 million (about one-third of his contributions from 
individuals) through the group, and Halter collected more than 
$450,000 (more than 11 percent of his total) through the earmarking 
effort. But direct spending by outside groups brought greater 
national attention to the races and energized activists, who are more 
likely to vote in low turnout primaries. Club for Growth, for example, 
moved from bundling contributions to its favored candidates to spending 
directly on ads. The group spent more than $200,000 opposing Sen. Robert Bennett in Utah in his convention contest against Lee. The Club also spent more than $200,000 opposing party favorite Sue Lowden in Nevada, where Sharon Angle ultimately won the primary.Besides Club for Growth, Americans for Job Security
 spent more than $600,000 supporting Ken Buck and opposing Jane Norton 
in the Republican race in Colorado. Tea Party Express spent more than 
$200,000 in the Delaware primary and more than $500,000 in Nevada, while
 the Senate Conservatives Fund spent $140,000 independently to help Buck in Colorado and $72,000 supporting Lee in Utah.Stay tuned for another post soon looking at the fundraising reports candidates 
filed on Jan. 31; they'll give hints about the most viable challengers, 
such as how much they pulled in from small donors and how much outside 
groups earmarked for them. The money for primary challenges can come from many directions, and 
while it doesn't guarantee success it plays an important role in shaping
 the Congress. We'll be watching closely and reporting regularly on the 
flow of funds in this year's primaries.Images: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas); former Sen. Joe Lieberman (R-Conn.)

        A small North Carolina-based super PAC with ties to a Republican Senate candidate reported two donations from LLC shell corporations today. While corporations and labor unions can make direct, and unlimited, contributions to these committees, they must be identified by the recipients. But if the donor company itself is shrouded in secrecy, that transparency evaporates. In this case, however, a review of corporate records reveals the likely sources of money -- a total of $50,000 -- to be a car dealership and the chairman of a direct-selling company.&nbsp;Grow NC Strong, a super PAC founded last May, reported raising $159,000 in 2013, and spending about $64,000 on consultants and overhead. The group made no independent expenditures on behalf of a candidate, although the group's website proclaims support for Thom Tillis, a Republican challenger to Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.). According to the filings made this morning, the group raised $54,000 in the second half of the year, including $25,000 donations apiece from Dawn Properties LLC and TC Investor LLC. Simple Google searches on the companies don't reveal much, but North Carolina corporate filing records shed more light on who is behind these donations.According to the state's records, Dawn Properties LLC shares an address and ownership with Randy Marion Automotive LLC, which was founded by Randall Marion, of Mooresville, N.C. Marion operates a chain of car dealerships, selling GM and Subaru cars.&nbsp;TC Investor LLC is slightly more mysterious. According to state records, it is registered by a corporate agent company that effectively shields the founder's name. However, another LLC is listed as the company's manager -- Praescient LLC, which is registered at a rented UPS mailbox. State records show that Praescient's registered agent is a Charlotte, N.C., attorney and its manager is a man named Robert Stevanovski; his wife, Sonya Stevanovski, is listed as a member. Both Marion and Stevanovski, and their wives, have contributed the maximum $2,600 apiece to Tillis' primary effort this election cycle.Stevanovski is chairman of ACN Inc, a company that provides energy and telecom services around the world, but using a "direct selling" method, which recruits independent sales representatives who then recruit other representatives.&nbsp;This isn't the first time the super PAC has reported donations from a shell corporation. In June, it received another $25,000 donation from a Georgia-based company called "Standard Holding Corp." Georgia state corporate records do not show a company by that name, but North Carolina records do, listing a Charlotte businessman named George Sywassink Jr., as managing member. Sywassink has contributed $11,800 to GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.).Image: Thom Tillis (AP).

        Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) is leaving Congress after 20 terms, and, like a number of his retiring colleagues, it looks like he'll leave a fair bit of money on the table.For much of this millenium, Waxman's seniority and status drove away challengers, and his fundraising was rather lackluster. But in 2012, Waxman eked out a close victory against independent Bill Bloomfield, a multimillionaire. Waxman raised roughly $1.9 million and spent $2.6 million -- almost twice the average cost of a winning House race -- but was outspent by a huge margin: Bloomfield reached into his own pockets for more than $7.5 million, which made up 95 percent of his spending.Even though he went into the red in the 2012 election, Waxman had more than $465,000 on hand at the end of September (campaign finance filings for the final quarter of 2013 are due Jan. 31). Waxman told Politico that he believes he could win in 2014, if he chose to run again, and showed strong support from&nbsp;donors in his district, which encompasses parts of Los Angeles, including Beverly Hills. His No. 2 source of money at the end of 2013's third quarter was the entertainment industry, which accounted for about $55,200. Lawyers and law firms and the real estate industry, both big sources of campaign cash in his district, ranked third and fourth on his top donor list.&nbsp;Waxman, who was known for his aggressive role in the healthcare overhaul fight and in taking on the tobacco industy, has picked up the most money this cycle from health professionals, who have given him slightly more than Hollywood -- $55,400.According to OpenSecrets.org data reaching back to 1989, that's the same donor base Waxman has relied on throughout his career. From 1989 to 2014, Waxman raised $9 million, and health professionals are his all-time No. 1 source of campaign cash, accounting for nearly $1.1 million over the course of his career. Hollywood is No. 2, with $786,000 and lawyers and law firms -- long a major source of cash for many Democrats -- are third, with $620,000.Waxman also operates a leadership PAC, LA PAC, which first put itself on the map in 2000. That year, it raised $549,000 and spent $429,000. It remained active throughout the 2000s, but in 2012, its fundraising activity dropped off dramatically, possibly because of Bloomfield's challenge. In that cycle, it raised just $139,000, compared to $410,000 in 2010.&nbsp;So far in the 2014 cycle, fundraising for Waxman's leadership PAC had lagged, pulling in just $19,000. As of Dec. 31, LA PAC had $82,000 in cash on hand.&nbsp;Waxman and other departing lawmakers can use leftover campaign funds to make donations to other candidates or party committees, or to charity.

        After more than three years of squabbling over issues ranging from food stamps to farm payments, the House of Representatives passed a new five-year farm bill Wednesday that would slash spending by $23 billion over the next 10 years, including $8 billion in cuts to food stamps and $4 billion in cuts to conservation programs. But despite those cuts, there is one program that is expected to see a $7 billion increase over the next decade: crop insurance.Last year, the farm bill was the sixth-most heavily lobbied measure on Capitol Hill, with 350 organizations spending cash to get their voices heard as it was being shaped. Much of that lobbying was done by agricultural groups like the American Farm Bureau and the International Dairy Foods Association, which listed the bill on a combined 34 of their disclosure reports in 2013; crop insurance was the issue that appeared the most frequently on these reports. And the two groups weren't alone in their push. Since 2006, the American Association of Crop Insurers and the National Association of Wheat Growers, for example, have each mentioned crop insurance in lobbying disclosure reports more than 60 times.  
        Together, the agricultural services (in the case of AACI) and crop 
production (in the case of the wheat growers) industries have some 
serious lobbying heft. In 2013 alone, the industries combined to spend 
more than $57.5 million on lobbying. Leading the charge among those 
groups were chemical giant Monsanto and the American Farm Bureau, which 
over the past five years have spent $36 million and $27.9 million, 
respectively. But crop producers and other agricultural groups 
haven't just been using their cash for lobbying; they've also sunk money
 into the campaigns of much of the congressional leadership in charge of
 crafting this year's farm bill.In the House, Agriculture 
Committee Chairman Frank D. Lucas (R-Okla.), has long been a favorite of
 agribusiness; he received more than $744,000 from the sector in the 
2012 election cycle, nearly 46 percent of his total campaign haul. That 
included $27,500 from the American Farm Bureau (including several of its state affiliates), the most of any 
candidate. He also received significant sums from the PACs of related 
organizations: $10,000 from the American Association of Crop Insurers 
and $6,000 from CropLife America. Other members of the House 
Agriculture Committee, like Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Reid Ribble 
(R-Wis.), have also benefitted. In the 2012 election cycle, both Ribble 
and Goodlatte received more than $8,000 from the PAC for the 
International Dairy Foods Association. In total during that cycle, 
the crop production industry gave more than $28,000 to Goodlatte and his
 leadership PAC, and nearly $46,000 to Ribble and his PAC.Those 
sorts of contributions haven't only been reserved for Republicans. Rep. 
Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the ranking member of the House Agricultural 
Committee, has relied on the industry for significant sums. Over his 
career, crop production and agricultural services have been Peterson's 
top donor industries. In the 2012 election cycle alone, Peterson and his
 leadership PAC received more than $453,000 from the two groupings; a 
combined $27,500 of that came from the PACs of the American Farm Bureau 
and the American Association of Crop Insurers.In the Senate -- 
which is expected to give its final approval to the farm bill as soon as
 today -- Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) has
 received more contributions from the crop production industry than any 
other senator. In the 2012 cycle, it sent more than $346,000 to her 
campaign account, with PACs from the Dairy Farmers of America and 
Monsanto each giving more than $7,000.Overall, the agricultural 
services and crop production industries, and the agribusiness sector as a whole, have heavily 
favored Republicans; in the 2012 election cycle, each&nbsp; invested 
more than 70 percent of their contributions in the GOP. Image: Michigan farm via Flickr user smruti_damania

        The controversial "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act," H.R. 7, which passed the House yesterday, could trigger some fireworks. When the measure was reported out of the very male House Judiciary Committee without amendment last week, female Democratic lawmakers
 protested in the hallway outside. And groups on both sides have been 
using it to drum up donations and urge their supporters to call their 
representatives. The bill, which has garnered the ire of women's issues and abortion rights groups, would disallow the use of tax credits to help subsidize purchases of health insurance by individuals. About 20 states have barred health plans offered in their exchanges under President Obama's health care overhaul from covering abortion; the House-passed measure essentially would extend those bans nationwide and make permanent the Hyde amendment -- a provision that has been approved over and over since 1976 that forbids the use of federal funds for abortions and prohibits Washington, D.C., from using its own funds to provide financial assistance to low-income women seeking abortions. The measure has very little chance of passing the Senate, and compared to heavyweight bills like the Affordable Care Act, H.R. 7 received relatively little lobbying attention. The usual suspects on either side of the debate, such as Planned Parenthood and Right to Life, listed it on their reports, as well as the Traditional Values Coalition, the Christian Coalition, Susan B Anthony List, and the National Council of Jewish Women. The bill's main author, Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), has clear support from the anti-abortion side of the debate. His second-largest donor in the first nine months of the 2014 election cycle is the Family Research Council PAC, which gave Smith $5,000.The 2012 data show support from anti-abortion interests to 85 of H.R.7's 171 cosponsors, with the average donation coming to just over $4,000 per House recipient. Smith was on the high end, taking in $14,800 from anti-abortion interests in the 2012 election cycle. On the pro-abortion rights side of the fence, though, campaign contributions are coming in fast and furious in the 2014 cycle. Pro-abortion rights groups made donations to 63 different House members through September 2013, with an average donation of around $4,000 per recipient. In the 2012 cycle, pro-abortion rights interests dispersed significantly more campaign cash per House member than their foes on the other side, with an average donation topping $10,000 per representative. None of these numbers factor in candidate-independent outside spending by super PACs and political nonprofits, which could be a game-changer for vulnerable House members running for re-election in 2014; abortion and contraception are set to be issues in many upcoming races.

        For the third straight year, spending on K Street is down, with only a handful of industries spending more on lobbying in 2013 than they did in 2012. Overall total spending on federal lobbying dropped 2.9 percent, from $3.31 billion in 2012 to $3.21 billion in 2013, according to a new analysis by OpenSecrets.org -- even though K Street was paid $805.7 million in the fourth quarter of the year, an increase over the third quarter's total of $779 million. Still, spending even in those three months was less than in the same period a year earlier.&nbsp; First the good newsOf the 92 industries that OpenSecrets.org tracks, 40 increased their spending.Topping the list, percentage-wise, were a handful of liberal-leaning interest groups. Gun control interests were No. 1, spending 824 percent more than they did, as a group, in 2012. That number is deceptive, however, since the interest group spent so little -- just $240,000 -- in 2012. In 2013, that jumped to $2.2 million.
        But their counterparts, gun rights
 groups, were No. 3 on the list of those showing the most growth in 
their spending, and spent far more to begin with. In 2012, gun rights 
advocates spent $6.1 million on lobbying, and in 2013, they spent $15.1 
million, for an increase of 147 percent. Two other industry groups with big increases in their spending on lobbying were liberal/Democratic and pro-abortion rights
 interests; they increased their outlays 437 percent and 55 percent, 
respectively. The liberal/Democratic groups went from $938,000 in 2012 
to just over $5 million in 2013. Much of that increase was driven by the
 Advocacy Fund, a nonprofit group with ties to liberal organizations 
that essentially takes donations to lobby on specific issues.&nbsp;In
 terms of dollars spent, the food processing and sales industry saw the 
biggest jump. In 2012, the industry spent $29.3 million lobbying and in 
2013, it spent $39.5 million.&nbsp;Dropping offBusiness associations
 led the list of biggest declines in dollars spent, cutting back about 
$64 million between 2012 and 2013. Much of that drop is due to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
 As we noted last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was the top spender
 on K Street, but it had a spectacularly "off" year in 2013, plummeting 
to $74.7 million in 2013, compared to $136.3 million in 2012.Electric companies notched the second-biggest drop, cutting back spending on lobbying from $145.9 million in 2012 to $129.6 million last year.Behind the Chamber, the biggest dollar decline for an individual organization was oil and gas giant Shell, which dropped from $14.4 million to $9 million between 2012 and 2013. Norfolk Southern sank $4.3 million between years (from $7.2 million to $2.9 million) and Abbott Laboratories dropped $4 million ($6.2 million to $2.2 million). Rounding out the top five biggest declines was the Association of American Railroads, which cut back $3.7 million, from $10.2 million in 2012 to $6.5 million in 2013.Once
 again, the total number of lobbyists employed at the federal level also
 declined, reaching its lowest point since 2002. According to the 
lobbying disclosures, there were 12,283 registered lobbyists in 2013, 
down from 12,436 in 2012 -- a 1.2 percent decline. The number of 
lobbyists peaked in 2007 at 14,838 and has been on a slide ever since. 
Last year's total is a 17.2 percent decline since that peak.

        Venture capitalist Tom Perkins recently launched himself into the news with a letter to the Wall Street Journal drawing parallels between what he views as liberal hostility to the "one percent" and Nazi hostility to the Jews in the 1930s. Perkins was quickly castigated by his Silicon Valley peers for voicing fear of a liberal "Kristallnacht," and he apologized on Monday. But other investors have made more temperate complaints, criticizing President Obama and liberals for being too hostile toward the rich, and Perkins' critique is reflected in a larger trend in campaign contributions since the 2008 elections.

Up through the 2010 cycle, contributions from the securities and investment industry (which we often refer to as "Wall Street") didn't lean heavily toward either Democrats or Republicans. Over time, each party received at least 42 percent of the industry's contributions. In the 2010 cycle, though, despite Democratic control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the industry shifted slightly in the direction of the GOP. In the 2012 cycle, nearly 70 percent of contributions went to Republicans. Democrats have done a bit better in the current cycle (so far we show figures only through Sept. 30, 2013), but securities and investment is still giving the lion's share of its funds to Republicans -- more so than in any cycle before 2012. &nbsp; The trend is even more striking in a comparison of the last two presidential elections. In 2008, Obama was the top recipient of donations from Wall Street, with close to double the total of his Republican rival John McCain. In fact, securities and investment was Obama's fourth largest donor by industry. But in 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney received more than three times as much money from this industry as Obama. Securities and investment was the No. 2 industry for Romney in the last election, but had fallen to No. 10 for Obama. Top donors followed suit: Obama's top 20 in 2008 included several from Wall Street -- but none from the industry appear on his 2012 list . Perkins' donations have followed the same pattern. Prior to the 2010 election cycle, he donated to both parties. Up until the 2008 cycle he had given somewhat more to Democrats than Republicans, and he even gave $2,300 to Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Since then he has both increased the amount of money he donates to politics and shifted almost all of it to Republicans. From 2009 on he gave more than $87,000 to Republicans, including $2,500 to Romney. Perkins, like much of Wall Street, has shown his discontent with his wallet as well as his mouth.

        Disgraced former Rep. Trey Radel (R-Fla.), who resigned yesterday, was a man of the PAC people, at least in 2013.PAC contributions made up 71 percent of the almost $300,000 that Radel, a former television reporter, raised in the first three-quarters of last year -- before reports of his cocaine purchase broke on Oct. 29. Three of them gave him $10,000 or more: New York Life Insurance ($10,500); Home Depot ($10,000); and Every Republican Is Crucial PAC ($10,000), the leadership PAC of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). Altogether, leadership PACs were Radel's third largest contributing industry in the 2014 cycle, giving him $18,184 -- behind air transport ($22,726) and health professionals ($20,750). Besides ERIC PAC, House Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) Freedom Project and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) Majority Committee contributed to Radel.It's not unusual for freshman lawmakers to draw contributions from their party's leadership PACs, as they often lack the clout or experience to have built a Rolodex of deep-pocketed donors. In a swift reversal, as this blog has noted, the party leadership dropped Radel almost instantly once news of the drug bust surfaced. Radel ended the third quarter of 2013 with $255,730 on hand, but listed $206,000 in unpaid loans -- that he made to his own campaign. Indeed, Radel personally financed 19 percent of campaign expenses during his 2012 bid (that's about the same amount PACs gave him in that race). It's unclear if the "Hip Hop Conservative" and tea party favorite will pay himself back, though he may not be too worried about it: OpenSecrets.org's analysis of his personal financial disclosure report for 2012 estimates his net worth at between $1.7 million and $6.4 million. Radel's campaign also listed a debt of almost $14,000 to the law firm Bracewell &amp; Giuliani.

        The state of our union is...riven.With 2013 going down as the least productive legislative year since the 1940s thanks to dug-in partisan politics, President Barack Obama reportedly will rely less on Congress and more on himself this year as he attempts to add to his legacy before the next presidential campaign begins in earnest. Still, when it comes to addressing income inequality and many other topics the president is prioritizing, it's hard to get much done without movement in the House and Senate, making it unlikely that Obama will strike too defiant a pose in his State of the Union address tonight.Here's a taste of what the president is likely to have on his list, and who's likely to be pushing one way or another.The economyAlthough we're only four months removed from the first U.S. government shutdown in nearly twenty years, it appears that the "push it to the limit" style of governing we've become so accustomed to over the past few years is in the rear-view mirror for Congress, at least for 2014. Congress passed a $1.1 trillion bipartisan budget deal in December that will keep the government running until September 2015, which means no shutdowns for at least 21 more months. The largest role that the new budget will play in fiscal policy in 2014 is the removal of $45 billion, or about half, of the sequester cuts that were set to go into effect this year. 
        The sector that's likely to feel the biggest relief due to the new budget is defense, as the new deal&nbsp;restores&nbsp;$22 billion in defense spending that had been cut due to sequestration. That's welcome news to contractors in the&nbsp;defense sector, which had 219 clients spend more than $97 million on lobbying last year, not including the last three months of the year. The industry also contributed more than $7 million to campaigns and committees&nbsp;in the first three-quarters of 2013.&nbsp;What the new deal doesn't do is raise the federal debt ceiling, which was suspended until Feb. 7 as part of the deal to end the government shutdown. That's not a hard-and-fast deadline for when lawmakers need to have a new debt ceiling deal, as&nbsp;Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said&nbsp;his department can keep the country paying its bills through "extraordinary measures" for another few weeks. Obama has said he won't cut deals to get the debt limit raised.&nbsp;With the budget brinksmanship over, at least for a few years, it has been&nbsp;reported&nbsp;that Obama wants to use the State of the Union to address a different economic problem: income inequality. In his speech, Obama will reportedly&nbsp;call for two actions: increasing the minimum wage to $10 per hour and extending unemployment benefits, which expired in December.&nbsp;The potential minimum wage increase is certain to attract attention from interest groups, as 232 organizations have&nbsp;mentioned it&nbsp;in their lobbying reports since 2006. Large unions like the&nbsp;American Federation of Government Employees&nbsp;and organized labor's trade group, the&nbsp;AFL-CIO, favor the increase; they&nbsp;spent $1.2 million and more than $5 million, respectively, on lobbying in 2013. Since 2008, the AFL-CIO has&nbsp;poured more than $1.5 million&nbsp;into federal elections, with 100 percent of those contributions going to Democrats. For the 2014 election cycle, all labor groups have contributed&nbsp;nearly $29 million through Sept. 30, 2013.On the other side, a number of corporations and trade groups, like the&nbsp;U.S. Chamber of Commerce&nbsp;and the&nbsp;National Restaurant Association, are against a minimum wage hike. Both groups have deep pockets -- particularly the Chamber, which spent nearly $205 million on lobbying over the past two years.&nbsp;As for extending unemployment benefits, the Senate has&nbsp;been attempting&nbsp;to reach a deal to renew the benefits since early January. House Speaker John Boehner has said he's open to an extension, but has stressed that&nbsp;offsetting cuts&nbsp;elsewhere in the budget must offset the spending.Immigration2013 looked like it would finally be the year Congress passed significant immigration overhaul.&nbsp;Over the past 15 years or so, Congress has repeatedly flirted with the idea of comprehensive change to the immigration process, but lawmakers have yet to produce a substantive law to show for it.For a few months last year, it appeared that was going to change. A push for serious immigration overhaul began to take shape in January, when President Obama called on Congress to pass a substantive reform bill in his 2013 State of the Union address.The Senate's bipartisan "Gang of Eight" drafted a bill to increase border security and provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, among other measures. As the bill came into focus, lobbying took off. The number of groups lobbying on immigration rose to 621 in 2013, nearly 35 percent more than at any time over the past fifteen years. Among them, 461 specifically listed lobbying on the Senate's immigration bill.&nbsp;Chief among those organizations were technology companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Yahoo!, which tend to hire high-skilled immigrant workers. Microsoft, in&nbsp;particular, put a lot into the effort. The company listed immigration issues in 45 disclosure reports last year, and the three bills it lobbied the hardest all had to do with changing the immigration and visa processes.Pro-immigration organizations like the National Council of La Raza and National Immigration Forum continued their lobbying push from previous years. And others, like the Agricultural Coalition for Immigration Reform, vastly increased their lobbying budgets from 2012, with most of their efforts specifically targeting the Senate bill.But not everyone favors an overhaul of the immigration system. Numbers USA, an anti-immigration group, has ramped up its lobbying budget to about half a million dollars over the past few years to counter bills like the Senate's. And other groups against the measure, like the Federation for American Immigration Reform, spent more than $130,000 on lobbying last year.With enough lobbying power behind it, the Senate bill passed with 68 votes. But that's where it ended, as Boehner repeatedly stated that the House&nbsp;would not take the measure up.&nbsp;There's still some hope for the bill, however. House leaders have said more than once that they intend to pass parts of the 2013 immigration measure this year, though on a piece-by-piece basis. That chamber's Republican leaders are set to unveil their own plan for immigration reform later this week, though whether that will turn into legislation is still uncertain. But the potential for change and compromise should keep many groups deeply invested in the issue in 2014.Climate changeIn 2013, Obama dedicated more than 600 words to the topic of energy and climate change, about 10 percent of&nbsp;his entire address. Superstorm Sandy had struck just a few weeks earlier, helping make the case more pressing, and environmental activists greeted Obama's strong language with enthusiasm.&nbsp;"[I]f Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will," he said last year, promising to counter congressional inaction with executive orders. Vows of further Oval Office action will be a hallmark of this year's speech, as well,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;members of Obama's Cabinet.&nbsp;The president did act in 2013: In June, he&nbsp;announced&nbsp;the Environmental Protection Agency&nbsp; would impose caps on the carbon dioxide released by coal and gas-fired plants -- new and old.&nbsp;Southern Co.&nbsp;and other large utilities lobbied for a House resolution&nbsp;disapproving&nbsp;the mandate, but after months of delays, a cap on emissions from new plants was&nbsp;formalized&nbsp;earlier this month. The EPA is now working on emissions standards for existing sites, which are expected in coming months.&nbsp;Energy executives are&nbsp;wringing their hands, and emptying their pockets, at the possibility of shuttering old and inefficient plants; Southern Co. alone spent nearly $13 million overall on lobbying in 2013.The energy and natural resources industry doled out&nbsp;$26.7 million&nbsp;in political spending in the first three-quarters of 2013, about 75 percent of which landed in Republican coffers. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) netted almost a million dollars of it -- more than $916,000 -- the most of any lawmaker in either chamber. Giving by the coal industry&nbsp;skews more Republican&nbsp;than even&nbsp;oil and gas&nbsp;or&nbsp;electric utilities&nbsp;contributions -- and could increase even more after the leak of a coal-washing chemical into a West Virginia river recently shut down the water supply for days.When it comes to money, whether for lobbying or campaign contributions, the enviro nonprofits are no match for their counterparts in the energy industry. Of the 20 most prolific organizations lobbying on the environment, the ratio of lobbying reports by environmental organizations to lobbying reports by energy corporations stood at about 1:27 in 2013, as of Sept. 30.For all of the political contributions and lobbying by energy corporations, though, it seems the green activists with whom they so often spar with remain hopeful."2014 has the potential to be a breakthrough year on climate in the U.S. and the president has the opportunity to show stronger leadership this year than he has," Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, told the&nbsp;Washington Post. "At the top of the list is a renewed commitment to get tough on the climate action plan."Health careIn this first State of the Union address since the implementation of Obamacare began, the president will be eager to tout success stories to counter some of the damaging press that hit the program beginning last fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial failures of the sign-up system and the fact that some people&nbsp;don't&nbsp;get to keep their doctor, contrary to what Obama promised, have been seized upon by Republicans gearing up for the midterm elections. Already, huge sums of money are being spent on ads attacking Democratic candidates for their votes to pass Obamacare.&nbsp;Americans For Prosperity, the politically active nonprofit with ties to the conservative activist billionaire Koch brothers, has already&nbsp;made multimillion dollar advertising buys&nbsp;targeting Democrats. Several liberal outside groups, including&nbsp;Organizing For Action, the nonprofit built from the 2012 Obama presidential campaign,&nbsp;have fired back&nbsp;-- though not dollar-for-dollar.All told, estimates of how much has been spent by outside groups in the 2014 cycle already&nbsp;tops $27 million, though how much more is unclear since much of the activity is in the form of "issue ads" that don't have to be reported this far away from an election. Many of the conservative ads focus on health care.&nbsp;For example, last week, Americans For Prosperity posted on its YouTube channel at least three different ads highlighting the "issue" of health care, targeting a specific candidate by name. One of those ads praised Rep.&nbsp;Steve Daines&nbsp;(R-Mont.) for "saying no to Obamacare" and the other two attacked Democrats on the issue, pointedly tying each candidate to Obama. In one, the group labels the president and Sen.&nbsp;Kay Hagan&nbsp;(D-N.C.)&nbsp;"best friends"&nbsp;and&nbsp;the other, which takes aim at Rep.&nbsp;Ann Kirkpatrick&nbsp;(D-Ariz.), focuses on Obama almost as much as Kirkpatrick.&nbsp;Well before the election, though, there's next month's deadline for raising the nation's debt ceiling, and some Republicans have made noises about holding it hostage until Democrats agree to repeal parts of the health law.&nbsp;Of course, health care is always a major topic in Washington; the industry, especially health insurance and pharmaceutical companies, has as much of a grip on Washington as ever. Through the first three-quarters of 2013,&nbsp;the top two industries&nbsp;spending on federal lobbying were&nbsp;pharmaceuticals and health products&nbsp;($171.7 million) and&nbsp;insurance&nbsp;($113 million.)And demonstrating the bipartisan oomph of the health sector, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress count&nbsp;health professionals&nbsp;and&nbsp;insurance&nbsp;among their top ten donors (Nos. 2 and 4, respectively,&nbsp;for Republicans, and Nos. 5 and 6 for Democrats).&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals&nbsp;are the 12th largest source of campaign cash for members of both parties.Images: Minimum wage rally via Flickr user CT Senate Democrats; immigration rally via Flickr user Anuska Sampredo; John E.

        Newly released emails and audio recordings show top officials from the National Right to Work Committee, a politically active nonprofit that is strongly opposed to labor unions, were extensively involved with a massive off-the-books mass mailing operation for state candidates in 2010. The activities directly contradict statements made to the Internal Revenue Service and may have involved violations of state law. At the center of the emails and audio recordings is a top aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) who was formerly a registered lobbyist for National Right to Work.In November, OpenSecrets.org reported that a former NRTWC political operative, Dennis Fusaro, had sent a letter to the organization's board of directors charging that the organization had broken state laws and falsely reported to the IRS that it had not participated in political activities. Fusaro has since released a flood of evidence that appears to back up those claims.National Right to Work is a 501(c)(4), a so-called social welfare organization that is allowed to lobby and to be politically active, as long as politics isn't a majority of the group's work. But that activity must be disclosed on the group's annual 990 tax forms, which must list the total amount spent on politics. In 2010, and in years since, NRTWC has said it engaged in no political activity and has failed to report any political spending. An affiliated group, Mid-America Right to Work, which operated in Iowa, Indiana and other states, also reported no political activity.The emails and recordings released this week, though, as well as interviews with some of the candidates involved with the mail program, reveal a great deal of direct political activity involving employees of NRTWC's operations across the country.
        Fusaro In IowaOne of the strongest pieces of evidence is a recorded phone conversation in which Fusaro and then-NRTWC vice-president Doug Stafford discussed the details of the Right To Work effort in Iowa in September 2010. At the time, Stafford was also a paid political consultant to Rand Paul in his campaign for Kentucky's open Senate seat. Following the election Stafford became Paul's chief of staff, and last spring took over operations of Reinventing A New Direction PAC (RAND PAC), Paul's leadership PAC and base of operations should he decide on a 2016 presidential run.At the start of the conversation, first posted&nbsp;by conservative blogger Lee Stranahan, Stafford explained to Fusaro that he had shifted a mail printing operation -- complete with high-speed printers that he said could run 100,000 pieces of mail in the final weeks before the election -- to Indiana. That operation was to be headed by Dimitri Kesari, NRTWC's director of government affairs. Fusaro and Kesari had feuded, but Stafford wanted Fusaro to understand that the operation was moved because Kesari was needed in Indiana -- not as a punishment.&nbsp;"I fully trust you to handle Iowa," Stafford told Fusaro. "I hope you will call me on a regular basis and let me know what you need. You will not need to report to Dimitri on the inner workings of the races in Iowa or anything like that. So, let's have a lot more direct contact on that."As the conversation progressed, Stafford and Fusaro discussed Right To Work's effort in Iowa. The first step was to send surveys to candidates asking their opinions on Right To Work issues, and then sending mailers to voters on how various candidates responded. That type of issue advocacy is permissible for a 501(c)(4) organization and needn't be reported as political activity, according to several attorneys consulted by OpenSecrets Blog.However, the next step, as described by Fusaro and Stafford in the conversation, quickly veered into political territory -- a "mail program" involving candidate cooperation."Part three is candidate mail -- selling these candidates in our target districts the mail because we believe this mail program is effective, and can make or break the difference" Fusaro said. "Even in a great year, it can be the difference between a close defeat and a close victory.""Absolutely," Stafford replied. "You can point out the number of candidates who won or lost by 100 votes last time, and do you want to be one of those guys or not?"Stafford also filled Fusaro in on the number of candidates Right to Work would target in Iowas with its mail program. LISTEN:Fusaro briefed Stafford on the status of candidates in the program.&nbsp;"We've got a whole list of people in various stages -- some people we've got copy, and we need to get them the copy, to get that first candidate approval, others we've got the approval, we're pretty much ready to go to print, but we're waiting the details of getting them to write the postage check," Fusaro said."Fine, we're ahead of the game, to a certain extent," Stafford replied. "I'd like to have everyone's approval and rolling, but ideally you send the first candidate letter out in 10 days anyway."Stafford then instructed Fusaro on what he needed to send to Kesari in the Indiana print shop.&nbsp;"What if the candidate A says I want to mail all the independents and Republicans, and he's approved the copy? What do we have to get to Indiana to get that mail out?" Fusaro asked."The data and the letter," Stafford told him. "As soon as you know that's going to happen ... Get the production sheet and the letter and when it needs to be sent. They'll get it done."On Monday, Stranahan posted another leaked email, this one from a NRTWC staffer named Jared Gamble (who passed away last summer) to several operatives, including Fusaro and Kesari, in which he laid out which forms need to be filled out by anyone wanting candidate mail to be sent. In another, also posted by Stranahan, Gamble said he was waiting for "the mail to start pouring in ... maybe more candidates have signed onto intros, wife letters, etc."Stafford declined to comment for this story, and the National Right to Work Committee did not respond to requests for comment.Wife lettersStranahan also posted an email from another NRTWC staffer with drafts of 13 of those so-called "wife letters" -- letters written in the name of a candidate's spouse or child, with personal appeals to vote for them.Ten of the letters included pertained to Iowa state legislative candidates. The tone of all the letters was intensely personal, frequently describing how the spouse met the candidate and fell in love. Another letter, written in the name of Shawnee Sorenson, the wife of Kent Sorenson -- who successfully ran for Iowa Senate in 2010 -- expressed outrage at Sorenson's opponent for publicizing that the couple had filed for bankruptcy.

The level of detailed personal information would have required close involvement with the candidates. OpenSecrets Blog attempted to contact all 10 candidates and ask who wrote the letters. Of those that responded, several said they cooperated with either NRTWC or individuals who are included on internal NRTWC emails about the mail program, while one claimed his wife had written the letter."The letter from my wife was written by my wife. I know that the NWRTC encouraged us, but she wrote it," Mark Chelgren, an Iowa state senator, first elected in 2010, told OpenSecrets Blog, adding that he thought his campaign had sent it out, not any one else.Stephen Burgmeier, an Iowa House candidate who lost in 2010, confirmed involvement by Right To Work staff."My wife and a staffer sat down and penned the letter," he told OpenSecrets Blog, and said the organization had paid for it, but that was reported on his campaign finance filings as an in-kind contribution.According to his campaign filings from that election, he reported an in-kind contribution of $1,372.80 from Fusaro, personally, for postage and mailing of a letter. A second in-kind contribution of $61.40 to the Iowans for Right to Work political action committee for reproduction was also reported.&nbsp;Nora Dirkx, the wife of Daniel Dirkx, another House candidate who lost in 2010, told OpenSecrets.org that she had worked with a man named Aaron Dorr, the head of Iowa Gun Owners, a group that worked closely with National Right to Work Committee, on the letter. Dorr is included on numerous emails to and from the mail operation in Indiana."They put together a whole bunch of letters after interviewing us and finding out what we stood for and stuff," Nora Dirkx said. "I just spoke with an interviewer and they wrote it out and I had to tweak it and say I liked it or didn't like it."One candidate who did win and is still in office, state Rep. Kim Pearson, referred OpenSecrets Blog's questions about the draft letter bearing her name to her attorney, and hung up. The attorney is unavailable until Jan. 31.&nbsp;Sorenson, who resigned from office last fall after an Iowa Senate Ethics investigation into whether he accepted money from the Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul presidential campaigns to endorse them, also refused to speak to OpenSecrets.But this morning, an email about Sorenson's "wife letter" appeared on Stranhan's blog, shedding light on what may have happened.&nbsp;The email, written by Dorr and sent to the "NRTWIowa" Google group, complains that an early draft of Sorenson's letter had the wrong city and state."Kent begged us to print his materials here because he was nervous that it was going to be screwed up," Dorr writes. "I assured him that it would be taken care of. What the heck am I supposed to tell him? You could have called if you didn't know his address."What's not yet clear is whether all of the wife letters were mailed, and if so, whether the candidates involved paid the postage and printing costs.ConsequencesMarcus Owens, the former head of the Internal Revenue Service's Tax Exempt division and an attorney with Caplin Drysdale in Washington, D.C., said there is no question -- that is direct political activity.&nbsp;"If the (c)(4) (non-profit) put it's money into it, either by employing the writer who wrote the letters, or paid for any of the various things that would be necessary to do that -- whatever is necessary to get the project going and then presumably print and distribute the letters -- all that would be political activity," Owens said. "Even if the candidate reimbursed them."Donald Tobin, a professor at the Ohio State University's Moritz School of Law, who specializes in politically active nonprofits agreed.&nbsp;"It means there's really no way to claim that's not political activity," Tobin said. "It's intervention in a political campaign. I don't see how it's not. It seems to be clearly political type activity designed to influence an election."Although there were several different legal organizations in the mix -- NRTWC and Iowa Right to Work (which is incorporated as Mid-America Right To Work), Tobin said that any direction from the national group on this type of activity would make it responsible to disclose political activity on its 990 form."If the Iowa organization is a tool of the national organization, it doesn't matter if they're separate legal entities," Tobin said. "Is Iowa doing this at the bidding of the national organization or not?"Tobin said he did not know of a specific case precedent that would show how failure to properly disclose political activity on the 990 would be handled by the IRS, but said it could be serious if it can be shown that the misrepresentation was a lie and not an oversight."If, in fact, someone purposefully lied, that's a real serious offense," he said. "But it's hard to prove someone lied."Owens, however, said he believed a case involving the 501(c)(3) organization that manages the college football Fiesta Bowl game might be an analogous example. That group denied participating in political activity but did in fact lobby and did operate an illegal straw donor scheme."The organization made political campaign expenditures, reported no disclosure on the 990 and that was enough for an indictment and guilty pleas," Owens told OpenSecrets Blog.&nbsp;"Based on what I've seen here, this activity is clearly attributable to the (c)(4) and the staff was not under the impression that something else was going on -- that these were benign nonpartisan letters. They were intended to drive voters to particular candidates and coordinated with the campaigns," Owens said. "Bottom line: people have gone to jail for precisely the facts that you are describing."National Operation?The emails and "wife letters" released by Fusaro and posted to Stranahan's website also strongly suggest that the National Right to Work campaign in Iowa was actually a national operation. They also show behavior consistent with what's described in one of the most controversial "dark money" stories since Citizens United -- the case of Western Tradition Partnership.&nbsp;Following the 2010 election, a box of documents was found in a meth house in Colorado that appeared to include drafts of "wife letters" and other mailing materials that were connected to a Montana group called Western Tradition Partnership. That group, a 501(c)(4) organization, got involved with Montana campaigns, targeting certain races with floods of last minute "wife letters" and provocative attack mailers and postcards.&nbsp;The head of WTP was a political operative named Christian LeFer. As it turns out, LeFer was also employed by National Right To Work. In an email posted by Stranahan, apparently from Gamble, LeFer is listed as a lobbyist for NRTWC. Gamble urges recipients of the email never to refer to him as part of an Right To Work program -- and places Stafford, Kesari and National Right To Work Committee president Mark Mix in the same category.Additionally, some of the draft letters from Iowa bear a strong resemblance to letters that were sent in Montana by LeFer's group.For example, a 2010 "wife letter" sent in the name of Joanne Miller, the wife of Mike Miller, a candidate for Montana's House of Representatives, reads:The draft of the "wife letter" for Chelgren in Iowa has a similar promise:  dc.embed.loadNote('http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1008889/annotations/141558.js');

And the draft of the "wife letter" for&nbsp;  dc.embed.loadNote('http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1008885/annotations/141566.js');A final hint at how large the operation really was comes from the audio recording of Fusaro and Stafford.

        We've learned a lot in the four years since the Citizens United ruling. Our data has tracked two major election cycles since then and, as we noted earlier this week, the ruling contributed to a surge in outside spending. As we reflect on the impact of the decision, and recognize its place as just one of many that have shaped campaign finance law, we offer a Citizens United recommended reading list -- a sampling of research papers, news articles, books and a few of the many blog items we've written about the decision's consequences, in no particular order.
