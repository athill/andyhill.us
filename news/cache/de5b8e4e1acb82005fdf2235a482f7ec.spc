There's a context in which to view the battle over voter restrictions that goes beyond whether Republicans are a bunch of meanies, and it has to do with the things parties can change easily and the things they can't.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-f604-52c8-f238-0eec995ef51e">I'll explain exactly what I mean in a moment, but first, the law at issue</span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/08/12/north-carolina-governor-signs-extensive-voter-id-law/"> was passed</a> just weeks after the Supreme Court's conservative majority gutted the Voting Rights Act, allowing North Carolina and other states to change their voting laws without the Justice Department preclearance that had been required since the 1960s. The N.C. law was basically a grab-bag of everything the Republican legislature and governor could come up with to make voting more difficult and inconvenient, particularly for those groups more likely to vote for Democrats. It included an ID requirement, of course, but also shortened the early voting period, eliminated "pre-registration" (under which 16 and 17-year-olds who would be 18 by election day could register before their birthdays), repealed same-day registration, and mandated that any voter who cast a ballot at the wrong precinct would have their vote tossed in the trash. Every provision was aimed directly at minority voters, young voters, or both.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-f604-52c8-f238-0eec995ef51e">As I've </span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/09/30/how-the-supreme-court-will-continue-helping-gop-game-elections/">argued before</a>, these kinds of restrictions are almost certainly all going to be upheld by the Supreme Court, because Anthony Kennedy, for all his pleasing evolution on gay rights, is firmly in the conservative camp when it comes to voting rights. That means there will be five votes in favor of almost any hurdle to voting that a GOP-controlled state can devise.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-f604-52c8-f238-0eec995ef51e">Making voting as difficult and cumbersome as possible for the wrong kind of people is a longstanding conservative project, but it has taken on a particular urgency for the right in recent years, which helps explain why <a href="http://prospect.org/article/22-states-wave-new-voting-restrictions-threatens-shift-outcomes-tight-races">22 states have passed voting restrictions</a> just since 2010 (and why </span><a href="http://prospect.org/article/mailers-sent-koch-group-appear-designed-misdirect-voters-key-us-senate-race">stuff like this</a> keeps happening). Republicans are doing it because they can, but also because they believe they must.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-f604-52c8-f238-0eec995ef51e">Both parties approach every election with a set of advantages and disadvantages, some of which are open to change in the short term and some of which aren't. The last couple of presidential elections, the Democrats had a more capable candidate than the Republicans did; that could be reversed next time or the time after that. The Democrats have policy positions that are on the whole significantly more popular than those of the Republicans, particularly on things like the minimum wage, taxes, and Social Security. While it would be possible for the GOP to change its positions on those issues, it's a slow process (as they're now seeing on gay rights), and sometimes it's impossible.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-f604-52c8-f238-0eec995ef51e">On the other hand, Republicans have a geographic advantage we've discussed before, with their voters spread more efficiently throughout the country, enabling them to keep a grip on a House majority even when more Americans vote for Democratic congressional candidates, as they did in 2012. Their dominance in rural states helps them stay competitive in the undemocratic Senate, where 38 million Californians elect two Democrats, and 600,000 Wyomingers counter with their two Republicans.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-f604-52c8-f238-0eec995ef51e">There isn't much Democrats can do about that weight sitting in the right side of the scale, but they have their own structural advantage in the fact that their coalition is a diverse one, including some of the fastest-growing segments of the population, while the Republicans are stuck with a constituency fated to shrink as a proportion of the population. In other words, the GOP's essential disadvantages lie in the interplay between what they believe and who they are. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-f604-52c8-f238-0eec995ef51e">One way to make up for those disadvantages is by making changes to the rules to tilt things a little bit back in your favor. Making it harder for some of the other side's constituencies to vote won't transform elections in and of itself—and it will often spur a reaction from Democrats as they redouble their GOTV efforts—but it can give that boost of a point or two that in the right circumstances can turn defeat into victory.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-f604-52c8-f238-0eec995ef51e">Republicans, of course, claim that all these voting restrictions have no partisan intent whatsoever—that they're just about stopping fraud and maintaining the integrity of the system. Not a single person in either party genuinely believes that's true (even if Republicans do believe that Democrats try to steal every election, they know that things like ID requirements and shortening early voting don't touch the biggest locus of actual voter fraud, which is absentee ballots). If it didn't help Republicans overcome their disadvantages, at least on the margins, you can bet they wouldn't be pursuing so many voting restrictions with such fervor. </span></p>

<div><article><p>Since 2005 deportations have been rising precipitously (see chart), with removals under Obama consistently exceeding those under George W. Bush. The <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_enforcement_ar_2013.pdf" target="_blank">total number of deportations under the Obama administration</a> now exceeds 2 million persons—<span class="pullquote-right">this is truly “mass deportation,” by far the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/yearbook-immigration-statistics-2012-enforcement-actions" target="_blank">highest sustained rate of removals</a> this country has ever seen</span>.</p>
<p>Mass deportation might suggest surging numbers of persons crossing the border illegally, an impression no doubt strengthened by this summer’s arrival of women and children fleeing violence in Central America. However, as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/opinion/do-it-yourself-immigration-reform.html" target="_blank">numbers from Princeton’s Mexican Migration Project show</a>, “the rate of undocumented emigration is nearing zero. It peaked at about 55 of every 1,000 Mexican men in 1999; by 2010 it had fallen to 9 per 1,000, a rate not seen since the 1960s.”</p>
<p>This dramatic fall-off in the numbers of undocumented immigrants entering the country is corroborated by the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_enforcement_ar_2013.pdf" target="_blank">government’s statistics on Border Patrol apprehensions</a>. From roughly 1.6 million arrests a year at the start of the new millennium, they’ve now fallen to about one-quarter that level. Indeed, last year the Obama administration deported almost 18,000 more persons than the Border Patrol detained.</p>
<p>It’s not immigration itself driving mass deportation; rather, it’s the politics of immigration. But this isn’t a simple Democrat/GOP split, for there are many Republicans who support immigration reform, from George Bush to John McCain, and major conservative idea-shapers do so as well, from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/opinion/brooks-beyond-the-fence.html" target="_blank">David Brooks</a> to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/rupert-murdoch-immigration-reform-cant-wait-1403134311" target="_blank">Rupert Murdoch</a>. Witness the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/immigration-bill-2013-senate-passes-93530.html" target="_blank">comprehensive immigration reform bill the Senate passed</a> with bipartisan support in the summer of 2013.</p>
<p>Rather, as <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/fixgov/posts/2014/08/04-immigration-tea-party-constituencies-parker" target="_blank">research by political scientist Christopher Parker shows</a>, there’s a split on the right, with those associated with the tea party significantly more likely than other conservatives to take a hard line on immigration. Summarizing his research, Parker found that while half of non-tea party conservatives support the DREAM Act, creating a limited path to citizenship for stellar young immigrants, less than a third of those who identify with the tea party do so. Conversely, less than half of non-tea party conservatives support changing our constitutional citizenship law, in which someone born here is automatically a US citizen; in contrast, two-thirds of tea party-identified conservatives support upending the Constitution to eliminate birthright citizenship. Most telling of all, Parker reports, fully four out of five conservatives who identified with the tea party reported being either anxious or fearful of “illegal immigrants.”</p>
<p>The GOP base is composed in significant part by an element that is racially fearful, and those House Republicans who most closely ally themselves with a tea party identity seem disposed to appeal to this faction by opposing immigration reform. But if racial pandering by some GOP House members helps explain why no immigration reform will come from Congress, what is holding Obama back from acting unilaterally?</p>
<p>In June, making the case for acting expeditiously, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/30/remarks-president-border-security-and-immigration-reform" target="_blank">Obama catalogued</a> the harms of continued conservative obstructionism:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s meant more businesses free to game the system by hiring undocumented workers, which punishes businesses that play by the rules, and drives down wages for hardworking Americans. It’s meant lost talent when the best and brightest from around the world come to study here but are forced to leave and then compete against our businesses and our workers. It’s meant no chance for 11 million immigrants to come out of the shadows and earn their citizenship if they pay a penalty and pass a background check, pay their fair share of taxes, learn English, and go to the back of the line. It’s meant the heartbreak of separated families.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these costs in mind, Obama stressed the urgency of reform, and promised that by the end of summer his administration would act on its own, if need be, “to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can. If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours.”</p>
<p>But it turns out that the job will have to wait some more, because, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/opinion/another-broken-promise-on-immigration.html" target="_blank">Obama explained earlier this month</a>, “I want to spend some time, even as we’re getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, I also want to make sure that the public understands why we’re doing this, why it’s the right thing for the American people, why it’s the right thing for the American economy.”</p>
<p>Not to disparage the importance of ducks, but administration insiders made clear there was another reason for the delay: the calculation that acting unilaterally on immigration might further imperil the ability of Democrats to hold onto the Senate in November. <em>The New York Times</em> editorial board <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/opinion/another-broken-promise-on-immigration.html" target="_blank">distilled Obama’s ulterior motive</a>: “The real reason, Mr. Obama’s aides have acknowledged, is that the midterm elections are upon us, and Mr. Obama believes the issue is politically too hot. He listened to political operatives who didn’t want to jeopardize Democratic control of the Senate.”</p>
<p>The electoral calculus is pretty clear, and was laid out in early August by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/upshot/the-political-risks-of-an-obama-executive-action-on-immigration.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=0" target="_blank">Brendan Nyhan</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/05/obama-might-allow-millions-of-illegal-immigrants-to-stay-it-would-be-a-huge-gamble" target="_blank">Aaron Blake</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em>: In the states with the most hotly contested Senate races, Latino voters are few and unlikely to sway the election, whereas unilateral immigration reform could substantially drive up GOP voter turnout in those critical races.
</p><p>This sort of cold strategizing invites responses couched in similar terms. For instance, two political scientists with deep knowledge of the Hispanic community, Matt Barreto and Gary Segura, stress the potential of even <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/09/29/241411_latino-groups-say-their-vote-could.html?rh=1" target="_blank">small numbers of Latino voters to swing tightly contested races</a>. And they emphasize the power of immigration reform to <a href="http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2014/09/08/did-dems-miss-an-opportunity-for-latino-mobilization" target="_blank">motivate, or demobilize, Latino voters</a>: in a summertime poll, 87 percent of Latinos said that administration-led immigration reform would make them more enthusiastic about voting for Democrats in the 2014 midterms; whereas 57 percent said a failure to act would make them less enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The hard reality of winning or losing elections demands attention to these sorts of gimlet-eyed calculations. But we also lose something important when we think about mass deportation simply as an electoral strategy. By one estimate, Obama’s decision to again delay reform will result in the <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/8/6118515/number-deportations-obama-delay-immigration-reform-elections-million" target="_blank">deportation of another 60,000 persons</a>. Not all would have qualified to stay under any reform he might have promulgated, but its reasonable to assume tens of thousands might have. Moreover, the background anxiety caused by the ever-present threat of removal will continue to dangle like a sword over millions.</p>
<p>In June, Obama recognized that continued mass deportation has “meant the heartbreak of separated families.” Dog-whistling on the right is responsible for much of this heartbreak. But fault also lies with the Obama administration’s repeated decisions to defer and delay acting unilaterally, for the last six years, and now for a few more months, at least.</p>

Gillespie charged that Warner just votes in lockstep with President Obama, while Warner charged that Gillespie is a partisan hack. But here's my question: Is independence really something we want in a senator? And even if it is, might it not rank way, way down the list of desirable qualities?</p>
<p dir="ltr">For the record, Mark Warner is one of the more conservative Democrats in the Senate (his <a href="http://voteview.com/senrank.asp">DW-NOMINATE scores</a> put him as the 43rd most liberal senator in the 112th Congress and the 50th most liberal in the 111th). And it's safe to say that there is no one running for Senate anywhere in the country less likely to be independent of his party than Ed Gillespie, who has spent his career as a Republican operative and lobbyist.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="pullquote-left">But as a liberal, should I be horrified that Gillespie would be a reliable Republican vote?</span> Not really. If he were more "independent," there might be the remote possibility that on some future issue he could defect to the Democrats. But that's a highly unusual occurrence, and not a particularly good criterion on which to base one's vote. Or think about it this way: Who does more favors for Democrats, a supposedly "independent" Republican like Susan Collins, who makes a lot of noises about bipartisanship but eventually votes with the rest of her GOP colleagues nearly all the time, or someone like Ted Cruz, who's such an extreme conservative (and such a natural troublemaker) that he regularly screws up the plans his party makes? When we call Collins, but not Cruz, an "independent," there's little question whose presence in the Senate is better for Democrats.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are many brands of independence, of course. There's Cruz's right-wing trickster brand, then there's John McCain's preening, opportunistic brand (if you look back at the times McCain went against his party, you'll see that each and every time it was when his party was on the wrong side of public opinion). But you know what a partisan offers? Predictability. The implied argument of "I'm an independent" is "You never know what I might do!" In other words, even if you don't like what I stand for, vote for me on the off chance that at some point in the future I might change my mind and come over to your side.</p>
<p>It's natural to say that we want thoughtful legislators who exercise their own unique judgment instead of just blindly following what their party wants them to do. But the vast majority of the time, the parties have very good reasons for the positions they take. Those positions are the product of a certain set of values and priorities. If you want to make the right choice, the best way to go about it is probably to determine which party more closely represents your values and priorities, and vote for the people from that party. Trying to figure out which candidate is going to be more independent isn't going to get you very far.</p>

That tragedy will obviously be big news, and it will lead more people to freak out about the disease, something that will be heartily encouraged by the cable news channels (or at least by Fox News, which has apparently been going a little crazy on the "We're all going to get Ebola because Obama hates America Benghazibenghazibenghazi!" line).</p>
<p dir="ltr">And freaked out we are. Let's look at some poll numbers:</p>
<ul dir="ltr"><li><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/178097/one-fifth-americans-worry-getting-ebola.aspx">Gallup asked people</a> "did you, personally, worry about getting the Ebola virus yesterday, or not?" Twenty-two percent of people said that they worried yesterday about getting Ebola.</li>
<li>Then they asked people how likely it was that they or someone in their family would get Ebola. Four percent said "very likely," 10 percent said "somewhat likely," 34 percent said "not too likely," and 49 percent said "not at all likely." On one hand, almost six in seven Americans are still tethered to reality on this topic. On the other hand, 14 percent think there's at least a fair chance they're going to get Ebola.</li>
<li>18 percent told Gallup that they think there's going to be a major Ebola outbreak in the U.S.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/06/most-are-confident-in-governments-ability-to-prevent-major-ebola-outbreak-in-u-s/">Pew Research Center </a>asked a slightly different question, how worried people are about getting it. A total of 32 percent said they were somewhat or very worried. But it wasn't the same for every group:</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><img alt="" class="media-image" height="480" width="300" src="https://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/ebola_concern_pew.png?itok=j4dvtcea" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Black people are probably more likely to know someone who has traveled to West Africa recently, which could explain why the number for them is higher. But still—47 percent?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ebola is a frightening disease, it's true. You wouldn't want to get it. But just for the record, here in America, this is how to know if you're at risk for getting Ebola: Has someone with Ebola vomited on you? No? Then you're not.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I exaggerate only slightly. We've had only one case in America, and while there may be a few more like him—people who went to a place where the disease was spreading and returned before becoming symptomatic, all while evading the precautions that were in place—it won't be more than a few. You aren't going to get it. </p>
<p dir="ltr">But fear always wins. Fear sure wins on TV, where they're actually asking questions like "Could the virus mutate and become airborne?" And we're all hard-wired for fear, because fear is highly adaptive from an evolutionary standpoint. The australopithecine who's terrified of every bump in the night is the one who survives to pass on his genes.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the totally-not-a-race-baiter Rush Limbaugh is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/06/3576544/rush-limbaugh-obama-isnt-closing-the-borders-because-he-thinks-america-deserves-ebola/">telling his listeners</a> that Barack Obama wants to let white Americans get Ebola as revenge for slavery. So of course we can all stay rational.</p>

<p><em>This article originally appeared at <a href="http://www.southernstudies.org/2014/10/americans-for-prosperitys-trail-of-voter-misinform.html"><strong>Facing South</strong></a>, a website published by the Institute for Southern Studies.</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he North Carolina State Board of Elections announced this week that it is investigating a <a href="http://www.southernstudies.org/2014/10/voting-rights-advocates-win-key-battle-in-ongoing-.html">controversial mailer</a> the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity Foundation (AFPF) sent to thousands of state residents that contained inaccurate information about voter registration.</p>
<p>The board was required to launch an investigation after a <a href="http://www.ncdp.org/press/north-carolina-democratic-party-files-formal-complaint">formal complaint</a> was filed by Casey Mann, executive director of the N.C. Democratic Party. The complaint noted that the mailer, sent by the AFP Foundation—whose chairman is David Koch—included incorrect information on the registration deadline, where to send voter registration applications, and where to get answers to questions about registration. As Mann wrote in the complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p>The above referenced statements were certainly known by the Respondent to be false and known by the Respondents to have the effect of misleading, intimidating, and/or discouraging participation in the North Carolina General Election by recipients not yet sufficiently informed with respect to the voter registration requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pullquote-right">Under North Carolina law, sending out a mass mailing or taking any other action where "the intent and effect is to intimidate or discourage potential voters" is a Class I felony</span>. The elections board <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/09/29/4193743/state-elections-board-investigating.html">told the <em>News &amp; Observer</em></a> that it has received at least 2,000 calls about the mailers, and has asked the AFP Foundation to send accurate information to the homes that received the misinformation.</p>
<p>AFPF has downplayed the significance of the mailers, releasing a <a href="http://americansforprosperity.org/north-carolina/newsroom/americans-for-prosperity-foundation-stands-behind-voter-registration-effort/">statement</a> that said they "contained a few administrative errors" that "were not substantive."</p>
<p>However, this is not the first time that the Americans for Prosperity organizations have been embroiled in a controversy about misleading voters. [Editor's note: Two related entities share the AFP name. The Americans for Prosperity Foundation is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, while its sibling organization, simply known as Americans for Prosperity, is a 501(c)(4).] The groups have faced similar accusations in at least three other states:</p>
<p><strong>* West Virginia.</strong> This past April, West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant said voters in at least eight counties in her state received "misleading and confusing" leaflets that could have led them to wrongly believe they were not properly registered to vote in the May primary, the <em>Charleston Gazette</em> <a href="http://www.wvgazette.com/article/20140422/GZ01/140429746">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Wendy McCuskey, director of AFP's West Virginia chapter, said the mailer was a nonpartisan effort targeting people who were not registered to vote. However, the leaflets encouraged residents to "update" their voter registration. McCuskey told the paper that there "may have been a few mistakes."</p>
<p><strong>* Virginia. </strong>Last year, voters in Virginia reported receiving a mailer from AFPF that told them they were not registered to vote when in fact many were. The mailer also threatened to contact neighbors of the recipients and say that they weren’t registered, further angering those who received the mailing.</p>
<p>Larry Haake, the general registrar in Chesterfield County, Virginia, said he received complaints about the mailer. "It's outrageous what they do," Haake <a href="http://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/news/2013-11-20/Front_Page/Votershaming_tactics_spark_angry_backlash.html">told the <em>Chesterfield Observer</em></a>, referring to AFPF. "Most of their information is wrong. They know it's wrong and they don't care."</p>
<p>Haake said the director of a local AFP office told him that the group was trying to "rile people up" in hopes of turning them out to the polls.</p>
<p><strong>* Wisconsin.</strong> In 2011, AFP was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/americans-for-prosperity-sent-misleading-absentee-ballot-far-more-widely-than-previously-known/2011/03/03/gIQAxhcywI_blog.html">accused of voter suppression</a> in the Wisconsin state Senate recall elections after a Democratic voter received an absentee ballot application from the group that contained incorrect information.</p>
<p>The form gave a return deadline that was two days after the election was set to take place. It also instructed voters to mail the ballots to what it claimed was "the absentee ballot processing center," but which was actually the mailing address for the conservative group Wisconsin Family Action.</p>
<p><strong>Cage the vote?</strong></p>
<p>Another mailer project undertaken by AFP in Wisconsin in 2010 appears to have been a blatant attempt to strike Democratic-leaning voters from the rolls during an election that featured a hotly contested U.S. Senate race pitting incumbent Democrat Russ Feingold against Tea Party Republican Ron Johnson, who ultimately won.</p>
<p>That year the liberal group One Wisconsin Now <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/voter-suppression-wisconsin-courtesy-gop-an">recorded speakers</a> at a meeting of state Tea Party leaders talking about mailing minority and student voters inaccurate information in an effort to prevent them from voting.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote-left">The strategy involved the Wisconsin Republican Party using its statewide voter file to compile a list of minority and student voters in targeted communities</span>. It would then give that to AFP, which would send a mailer marked "do not forward" telling recipients—wrongly—that they must call and confirm their registration information, and that if they did not they would be removed from voter lists.</p>
<p>However, the real purpose of the mailers was to see if any were returned as undeliverable. If they were, those voters would then face challenges by Tea Party recruits at the polls for not legally residing at their registered addresses.</p>
<p>It's a practice know as “voter caging.” Supporters claim it prevents voter fraud, but it's been used to target voters based on race, national origin, and political affiliation in a way that raises legal questions, according to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/122974950/Ballot-Security-and-Voter-Suppression">report</a> by the Brennan Center for Justice, a national voting-rights advocacy group:</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal Motor Voter Act prohibits state officials from relying on undeliverable mailings to purge voter rolls. Additionally, federal courts have stepped in to prohibit voter caging campaigns that are racially targeted. When a challenger uses a voter caging list to challenge the ineligibility of voters, he or she attempts to accomplish indirectly what the state is explicitly prohibited from doing -- disenfranchising a voter based solely on an undelivered mailing. The challenger may therefore be helping the state to violate federal law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some states explicitly prohibit the use of voter caging lists as the sole basis of a voter challenge—including North Carolina. NC Gen Stat § 163-88 <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/north-carolina/2011/chapter163/article8/section163-88">states</a>: "A letter or postal card mailed by returnable mail and returned by the United States Postal Service purportedly because the person no longer lives at that address or because a forwarding order has expired shall not be admissible evidence in a challenge heard [on Election Day]."</p>
<p>At this point, it remains unclear who AFPF was targeting with its North Carolina mailer. People have reported receiving mailers that were addressed to children, deceased relatives, and relatives who live in other counties or states. One was even sent to someone's cat, as the<em> News &amp; Observer</em> <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/09/29/4193743_state-elections-board-investigating.html?rh=1">reported</a>. The mailers were marked "Electronic Service Requested," a paid service where the post office redirects undeliverable mail for further processing according to the customer's instructions.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.southernstudies.org/sites/default/files/ncsbe_notice_afp_mailers.pdf">Notice of Complaint</a> sent to AFP's national office in Virginia by the North Carolina elections board asks the group for information on demographic selection criteria for recipients as well as who crafted the mailer's content, where it was distributed, the individuals and/or vendors used to produce the mailing list, and a list of other states where AFP distributed a substantially similar mailer in the past six months. Dated Sept. 30, the notice asks AFP to respond within five days.</p>
<p><strong>AFP's voter suppression connection</strong></p>
<p>The controversy over the mailer comes as AFP is carrying out the largest field campaign in its 10-year history in North Carolina, as <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/01/outside-groups-wage-turnout-battle-in-north-carolina-senate-race/16419277/">reported</a> by <em>USA Today</em>. The state is a key battleground for control of the U.S. Senate, with a close race underway between incumbent Democrat Kay Hagan and Republican challenger Thom Tillis, speaker of the state House.</p>
<p>The public's concern about the mailer's intent has been amplified by AFP's close ties to the billionaire Koch brothers of the Koch Industries oil and chemical conglomerate and their close North Carolina ally, millionaire businessman Art Pope, all of whom have been involved in efforts to restrict voting. The Kochs helped found AFP and are major funders of the group, while Pope has contributed millions of dollars to AFP and served as a director of the group until he was appointed state budget director in 2013, a position he resigned last month.</p>
<p>The Kochs <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-gop-war-on-voting-20110830">helped fund a systematic campaign</a> coordinated by the corporate-backed American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) to promote legislation aimed at making it more difficult to vote. ALEC has been behind bills introduced in dozens of states including North Carolina requiring voters to provide proof of citizenship before registering, creating barriers for groups registering new voters, ending same-day registration, barring ex-felons from voting, and requiring photo ID to vote—measures that have a disproportionate impact on traditionally Democratic constituencies.</p>

But their reaction was remarkably muted. "None of the top House GOP leaders (Speaker John Boehner or Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy) issued statements. Ditto the RNC," <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/gop-remains-mostly-silent-supreme-courts-gay-marriage-move-n220071">reported NBC News</a>. "And most strikingly, we didn't hear a peep about the Supreme Court's (non)-decision on the 2014 campaign trail, including in the red-state battlegrounds." The only one who issued a thundering denunciation was Ted Cruz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though the GOP's discomfort with this issue has been evident for a while, with the unofficial start of the 2016 presidential campaign just a month away (after the midterm elections are done), the issue of marriage equality is going to become positively excruciating for them. Many people saw the Court's denial of cert in the five cases they confronted yesterday as a prelude to the case they'll eventually take, the one that will probably strike down all the state bans on same-sex marriage and make marriage equality the law of the land. That could happen in the Court's current term, which runs from now until next summer. But it's even more likely that it would come in their next term, the one going between October 2015 and the summer of 2016. If that happened, it would land like a bomb in the middle of the presidential campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a certain way, the GOP's current dilemma is reminiscent of where Democratic presidential candidates were during the 2004 race, when the marriage issue burst into national attention after the Massachusetts Supreme Court declared in November 2003 that the state had to allow gay people to marry. Most of the candidates were unsure of what their position was or should be, trapped between the primary and general electorates. Howard Dean had been considered by many a wild-eyed liberal in no small part because as governor of Vermont he had signed a civil unions bill, even though he opposed full marriage rights. Before long, most of the Democrats running settled on that as their position too — civil unions yes, marriage no (the exceptions were Dennis Kucinich, Al Sharpton, and Carol Moseley Braun, all of whom supported marriage equality). None of them seemed to want to talk about it, and they were pulled one way by the general electorate, and another by the principle involved, and a party base that was moving to the left.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There's a different quandary for today's Republican presidential contenders. You have a general electorate supporting change, and a Republican base committed to the rapidly eroding status quo. And consider that the first three Republican contests are in Iowa, relatively moderate New Hampshire, and extremely conservative South Carolina, which happens to be one of the states affected by yesterday's ruling. Ed Kilgore <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2014_10/will_it_play_in_sioux_city052359.php">suggests </a>that Iowa in particular is going to pose a challenge:</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr">But the Iowa problem is real for Republicans: it became, because of a relatively early state judicial ruling allowing same-sex marriage, Ground Zero for conservative resistance to marriage equality. As recently as two years ago, I<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2012_08/liveblogging_from_the_belly_of039174.php"> attended</a> an Iowa political event, along with four or five former (and possibly future) presidential candidates, that was heavily focused on removing the judges responsible. I don't think the majordomo of that event, Bob Vander Plaats (often called a<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/05/the-iowa-caucus-kingmaker/308446/"> "kingmaker"</a> thanks to his timely support for the last two Iowa Caucus winners), is about to cave anytime soon. And so long as there is an opportunist or two in the presidential field who's frantic for right-wing support (I’m looking at you, Bobby Jindal!), the odds of this issue being "off the table" in Iowa are very low.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Ed's last point is critical. If all the candidates had a tacit agreement not to make too much of it, the issue might not be that big a deal. But all it takes is one who won't go along to force all the other candidates to talk about it. And we already know that Ted Cruz, who will be bidding to be the choice of social conservatives, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/10/07/morning-plum-republicans-dont-want-debate-on-gay-marriage-ted-cruz-has-other-ideas/">isn't going to let it go</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now put that in the context of the long-running conflict within the GOP between the Tea Party base and the more practical-minded establishment. When the party bigwigs are saying, "We really need to talk about something else," the base is going to conclude that they are once again being betrayed by a bunch of elite Washington Republicans who are perfectly happy consorting with the sodomites who inhabit their metropolis of depravity. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Which, to a certain degree, is true. Many of those elite Washington Republicans may still write columns in support of "traditional marriage," but they also regularly interact with gay people. They'll come around before long, which will only make the base angrier.</p>
<p>The 2016 Republican primary was already shaping up to be a hugely entertaining bloodbath. This only makes it more exciting. </p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he inadequate quantity and quality of American jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face. It’s not the only challenge: Poverty, inequality, and stagnant mobility loom large, as well. But in a nation like ours, where wages and salaries are key to the living standards of working-age households, all these challenges flow from the labor market problem.</p>
<p>OK, but this is a supposed to be an article about technology. What’s the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem? As a D.C.-based economist who’s been working on the issue of jobs and earnings for almost 25 years, trust me when I tell you that most policy makers believe the following:</p>
<p><em>“Yes, there’s a problem of job quantity and quality, but it’s largely a skills problem. Because of recent technological advances, most notably computerization, an increasing share of the workforce lacks the skills to meet the demands of today’s workplaces. </em></p>
<p><em>What’s more, the pace at which technology is replacing the inadequately skilled is accelerating—think robotics and artificial intelligence. These dynamics explain growing wage stagnation, wage inequality, and the structural unemployment of those without college degrees.”</em></p>
<p>Problem is, most of that is wrong.</p>
<p>Technology and employers’ skill demands have played a critical role in our job market forever, but they turn out to be of limited use in explaining the depressed incomes of today, or of the past decade.</p>
<p>Consider: The demand for college-educated workers has actually <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w18901">slowed quite sharply</a> since 2000 and their real wages <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/why-americas-workers-need-faster-wage-growth/">have been flat</a>. If that fails to surprise you, you may well be someone who’s recently graduated and looked for work. If that does surprise you, you may well be a high-level economic policy maker.</p>
<p>Before I go any further, allow me to assert the following, and not just to inoculate myself, but because I really believe it: Technology is a hugely important force in economies across the globe. Neither I nor any economist I know would question that we should want the most skilled workforce we can get, not to mention the best educated electorate. There’s no question that those with more education earn more than those with less—the college wage premium is as high as it’s ever been. No question that the upward mobility of far too many disadvantaged children is thwarted by unacceptably high barriers to attending and completing college. No question that way too many people lack the skills they need to make it in today’s job market.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote-right">But a number of important new studies show that it’s not technology-driven skill deficits that are depressing wage and job growth</span>. It’s the weak economy, not yet recovered from the Great Recession, it’s persistently high unemployment robbing workers at almost every skill level of the bargaining power they need to claim their fair share of the growth, it’s terrible fiscal policy, it’s large and persistent trade deficits, it’s imbalanced sectoral growth as finance booms while manufacturing lags.</p>
<p>The policy implications that flow from these findings are profound. Improving workers’ skills is obviously insufficient. Supply doesn’t create demand. In fact, there’s <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci20-1.pdf">evidence</a> that as demand for college-educated workers has tailed off, they’ve been moving down the occupation scale, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-06/college-grads-taking-low-wage-jobs-displace-less-educated.html">displacing</a> workers with lower education levels.</p>
<p>If we want to improve the quantity of jobs, we’ll have to do more to promote labor demand. We’ll need to worry less about robots and more about austere fiscal policy, imbalanced trade, weak capital investment, and bubbles and busts. If we want the jobs we create to be of higher quality, we’ll have to do more to lift workers’ bargaining power, by enforcing labor standards, raising minimum wages, and leveling the playing field for collective bargaining. Supply-side solutions targeting workers’ skills may well help the targeted individuals, but they won’t help raise the number and quality of jobs.</p>
<h3>Technology and jobs</h3>
<p>The impact of technology on work and wages is and always has been profoundly important. The most popular economists’ theory about how this plays out is “skill-biased technological change,” or SBTC.</p>
<p>The conventional SBTC story is simple. As technology in the workplace evolves, it raises the cognitive demands that employers make of their workers. How that affects individual workers depends on the extent to which they productively interact with the new technologies.</p>
<p>In the econo-mese of labor economics, the relevant terms here are <em>complements</em> and <em>substitutes</em>. If a new machine does what you do but does it for less, you’re a substitute. Not good. But if the nature of your job and the skills you bring to it enable you to use the new machine to produce more or better output than the machine could produce without you, you’re a complement. Tech change is “biased” in your direction. Pass go and collect a hefty paycheck.</p>
<p>Is SBTC a useful model? Over the very long term, yes. Over the near term, it can be misleading. It’s a good telescope and a lousy microscope.</p>
<p>Taking the long view, the complementarity of skill demands and educational upgrading is why, despite the large increase in their share of the workforce, the most highly educated workers still have the lowest unemployment rates. For as long as we have data on occupations, we can observe technologically-induced “occupational upgrading,” that has enabled the increasing share of skilled workers—complements to the process—to be absorbed into the workplace.</p>
<p>Isn’t it possible for technology to displace so many workers that it creates more problems than it solves? What if the technological advances in the workplace flip too many of us from complements to substitutes? The greater presence and improved capacities of computers, robots and artificial intelligence in the workplace have led some to believe that the pace at which technology is displacing workers has accelerated.</p>
<p>Yet here again, evidence is lacking.</p>
<p>There are at least two ways to evaluate this concern about increasing technological unemployment: macro and micro. From a macro perspective, if technology were contributing to more output with fewer workers (more precisely, fewer hours of work), productivity growth would accelerate. In fact, as shown in the figure below, the rate of productivity growth appears to have <em>de</em>celerated in recent years (productivity changes are notoriously jumpy so the figure includes a smooth trend to help reveal the recent deceleration).</p>

<p>It’s worth remembering that much of what we hear about technology replacing workers is anecdote. Still, there are some pretty compelling anecdotes out there, and given that data is the plural of anecdote, I’m certainly open to the possibility that there’s more here than meets the eye. But as I recently <a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/wheres-the-automation-in-the-productivity-accounts/">wrote</a>, “the robots-are-coming advocates need to explain why a phenomenon that should be associated with accelerating productivity is allegedly occurring at a time when the trend in output-per-hour is going the other way.”</p>
<p>The micro research on this question is particularly interesting. Economist David Autor, along with various co-authors, has taken the most granular look at how tech change is interacting with jobs through the lens of tasks. He breaks these tasks down into three bins: routine, manual, and abstract.</p>
<p>Routine tasks are repetitive and rules-based, like highly repetitive production work. If you stand in the same place and do the same thing at regular intervals on a production line and you haven’t yet been replaced by a robot, you soon will be.</p>
<p>Manual tasks are relatively simple for people but hard for computers. The person who comes into my office to empty the wastebasket appears to be doing a pretty straightforward bit of work, but because I may move the wastebasket around, she ends up doing something—noiselessly and effortlessly identifying the trashcan—that’s easy for her but hard to automate.</p>
<p>Autor provides a nice example of what differentiates these two different kinds of jobs/tasks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Modern automobile plants…employ industrial robots to install windshields on new vehicles as they move through the assembly line. But aftermarket windshield replacement companies employ technicians, not robots, to install replacement windshields. Why not robots? Because removing a broken windshield, preparing the windshield frame to accept a replacement, and fitting a replacement into that frame demand far more real-time adaptability than any contemporary robot can approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abstract tasks involve high levels of reasoning, mastery of complicated stuff like statistical analysis, and nuanced communication.</p>
<p>Armed with this typology, Autor tackles both ends of the “technological unemployment” thesis and finds it wanting. He finds more techno-complements than substitutes at the high end of the wage/skill spectrum and fewer opportunities for automation at the low end. Repetitive production jobs will continue to go missing, but that’s a very long-term trend. Higher end jobs will continue to complement technology while the inability of computers to replace workers in manual jobs that require “flexibility, judgment, and common sense remain[s] immense.”</p>
<p>That’s jobs. What about wages?</p>
<h3>Technology and wages</h3>
<p>When it comes to wage trends, SBTC is even a less useful tool. Generally speaking, SBTC would predict a fanning out of wages by skill levels, with complementarity, or the skill bias, rising as you climb up the pay scale, and ever-increasing substitutability, or a negative bias, as you go down the scale.</p>
<p>The problem, as Larry Mishel and colleagues at the Economic Policy Institute <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/technology-inequality-dont-blame-the-robots/">have shown</a>, is that this has not been the actual pattern of wages over the past few decades. Both in real and relative terms, actual wage trends have not moved the way SBTC says they should.</p>
<ul><li>While wages fanned out as SBTC would predict in the 1980s, they’ve generally failed to do so since. For example, mid-level wages fell relative to low wages throughout much of the 1990s.</li>
<li>SBTC would predict that the wage premium of more highly educated workers would continue to rise, yet starting around the mid-1990s, that differential slowed, if not plateaued. This flat trend is inconsistent with the oft-made claim that SBTC is driving post-2000 wage inequality.</li>
<li>SBTC would predict productivity gains would be reflected in the wages of workers with complementary skills to the new technologies. But productivity increases have diverged not just from the real pay of the lowest paid workers, but from those of middle and upper-middle wage workers as well.</li>
</ul><p>David Autor in particular has tried to save SBTC by coming up with interesting ways in which it could still be tapped to explain these wage patterns. Most prominently, he and colleagues argued that based on the tasks-framework discussed above, SBTC in the 1990s was leading to a polarization of both jobs and wages (as opposed to the more linear impact of traditional SBTC: bad for the bottom, less bad for the middle, good for the top). <span class="pullquote-left">Routine production jobs, which tend to pay solid, middle-class wages, got whacked because they’re easily mechanized</span> (so they’re substitutes); manual, non-routine jobs at the low end of the wage scale did better because they’re much harder to automate; and high-end, high-paying jobs did well because they’re complementary to the new tech.</p>
<p>But things moved around again in the 2000s in ways that forced yet a new morphing of SBTC. Polarization was gone, and Autor wrote that the formerly “U‑shaped growth of occupational employment came increasingly to resemble a downward ramp in the 2000s,” with pretty strong growth at the bottom and not much in either the middle or top.</p>
<p>This turns out to be an important analytic problem. Researchers have made interesting and compelling linkages, at least at the micro level, between technology and tasks at work. But they’ve failed to tie these occupational employment trends to wage inequality. Mishel, et al, put not too fine a point on it (my bold): SBTC, polarization, and all that task analysis simply “fail to explain the key wage patterns in the 1990s [they] intended to explain, and provide no insights into wage patterns in the 2000s. <strong>We conclude that there is no currently available technology-based story that can adequately explain the wage trends of the last three decades.</strong>”</p>
<p>If you have to bend a theory like SBTC that much to explain the changing reality of wage trends over the past few decades, it’s probably not the right one. It clearly helps explain the long-term absorption of so many more college-educated workers, and that still secures the theory a place on the economics mantelpiece. But it doesn’t explain much about wages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>o, what can economics tell us about the impact of technology on jobs and wages?</p>
<p>While I still think that the long-term positive correlation between technology and skill demands will eventually reassert itself, right now we’re going through one of the rare periods when the evidence for it is especially elusive. Indeed, in the 1990s, it appears that employers over-estimated the complementarities between computer technology and high-skilled workers. We were still working off a tech-hiring bubble when the other bubble—in housing—burst in late 2007. Such an explanation tells you a lot more about bubbles and busts and their impact on jobs and wages than technology stories do.</p>
<p>Second, based on the macro and micro evidence presented above, I’m a lot less worried about the threat of automation than I am about the threat of bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand, trade, income and opportunity. The automation threat is always a possibility and it demands attention. But the absence of a progressive economic policy agenda is a reality, not a threat.</p>
<p>Finally, EPI is right. The technology stories economists tell us fail to fit the wage data—which means we’ve got to get beyond skill solutions as our favored response to inequality and stagnation.</p>
<p>That’s not to disparage more and better education, which remains critical, especially to those who face ever-higher access barriers.</p>
<p>But with great respect for the very smart phone in my pocket and the computer I’ve been staring at for the last few hours, if we fail to deal with the lack of bargaining power suffered by workers across the spectrum of wages and skills, the bubble and bust cycles that have defined the macroeconomy in recent decades, the erosion of labor standards, the austere fiscal policy, the sectoral imbalances, and the absence of full employment, too many of us will continue to experience eroding living standards—regardless of technological progress.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ast July, Facebook came under fire for a social contagion experiment that manipulated users’ news feeds in order to test users’ emotions. Employing a technique known as social contagion mapping, the experiment used the newsfeeds of 689,000 users; manipulating their newsfeeds, Facebook sought to find out if putting negative posts at the top of the experimental group’s newsfeeds would cause them to experience negative emotions. Facebook issued an apology and released a statement on October 2 claiming that future research on users would be “subjected to greater internal scrutiny,” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/technology/facebook-promises-a-deeper-review-of-its-user-research.html">according to the <em>New York Times</em></a>. But the details of how the new standards would be implemented remain unclear.</p>
<p>Since its launch over a decade ago and now with over one billion users, Facebook propelled the entire world into a new era of communication, socializing, relationships and emotions. Though everyone from your Great Aunt Mildred to the president of the United States is now on Facebook, the company, and social media in general, is not safe from criticism.</p>
<p>While it was clear that users felt the experiment was a violation of their privacy, the manipulation and lack of transparency on how the company will move forward does not appear to have caused any significant amount of Facebook users to abandon the site; social media as a tool for communication is now deeply embedded in our society. <em>The Prospect</em> sat down with social media expert Deanna Zandt, author of <a href="http://www.sharethischange.com/"><em>Share This! How You Will Change the World With Social Networking</em></a>, to discuss how social media affects our well-being, and using social media as a tool for good.</p>
<p>Zandt is currently involved with a project to explore social contagion via social media in grassroots actions, as evidenced in the spread of the Arab spring and other social movements. But the lessons of social contagion extend beyond movements to the individuals connected by these networks.</p>
<p>The following discussion has been edited for concision and clarity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nathalie Baptiste: What is social contagion mapping?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deanna Zandt:</strong> At its very simplistic core, social contagion mapping is trying to figure out how interactions affect each other’s emotions and moods. It tries to figure out if there is technology that can help us draw a diagram of how we might influence one another with what we have to say. Interaction with others changes something in our brains; we’re actually hardwired that way. The mapping alone is very innocent. It’s when it’s used to manipulate and influence feelings is when we get into sticky territory.</p>
<p><strong>NB: So, mapping can be used for effective, innocent information gathering, but a lot of people were uncomfortable with what Facebook was doing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DZ:</strong> The Facebook study wasn’t well formed and ultimately wasn’t totally useable. The sentiment analysis software that they used was very basic. If [the software] saw the word “great,” it would associate it with a positive feeling, without taking the entire sentence into context. If Facebook was just using our data to map out how people’s emotions affect one another, or use it to present some sort of scientific analysis, that would be fine.</p>
<p>We have to understand that Facebook is going to want to fine-tune its relationship with us, in a way that benefits their company. It’s what we’ve signed up for when we clicked Terms and Conditions. The unfortunate part is that those Terms and Conditions aren’t clear. Facebook changes their privacy policy a lot; users don’t understand what they’re getting into and, as a result, [end up] submitting themselves to these kinds of experiments.</p>
<p>We should all be very, very aware of the fact that as a for-profit, publicly traded company, Facebook is going to do whatever it needs to do to continue to make us as profitable for them as possible. It isn’t out there to improve our relationships with one another. Facebook is out there to improve its relationship with us.</p>
<p><strong>NB: How would Facebook achieve improving its relationship with us? Would it try to make us happy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DZ:</strong> Yes, if Facebook was this entirely negative place where all you saw were crappy things happening to your friends, how often would you check your news feed? Pictures of your friends getting married, having kids and their cute dogs are the kinds of things that dose you chemically. <span class="pullquote-right">There are studies that show that when we’re active on social networks, we’re getting dosed by oxytocin</span>--the same feeling you get when you’re cuddled. Facebook wants to maximize that feeling as much as possible, so that we coming back as much as we can.</p>
<p><strong>NB: What does it say about us as a society if just seeing words or pictures on a computer screen can change the way we feel?</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13.3333339691162px; line-height: 20.0063056945801px;">DZ: </strong>It’s not so much that it’s a problem with us, we’re just hardwired to be social creatures and to be in touch with one another. We have certain neurons in our brain that exist so that when we see something happening to somebody else, our brain actually tries to recreate that feeling for us.</p>
<p><strong>NB: Can we still use social media as a force for good?</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13.3333339691162px; line-height: 20.0063056945801px;">DZ: </strong>Yes, definitely. It’s not the technology or the tool. Whenever there’s controversy regarding social media, people will say things like, “this reveals the dark side of technology,” when this actually just reveals the dark side of humanity; technology is just the tool. Humans will always find ways to make each other laugh or to torture each other, and social media is just another way to do that. That’s not to let technology off the hook, especially when it’s designed specifically to manipulate and coerce people in a way that they haven’t agreed to. It’s a nuance; it’s both and it’s neither.</p>
<p><strong>NB: What about hashtag activism? Is it just another form of activism?</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13.3333339691162px; line-height: 20.0063056945801px;">DZ: </strong>Yes, absolutely. Hashtag activism is useful for a lot of reasons, we saw this most recently with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23YesAllWomen&amp;src=tyah">#YesAllWomen</a> that sparked and shaped a conversation that otherwise wasn’t happening [about violence against women]. But I prefer to call it “digital consciousness-raising.” In the 1970s, women would get together and talk about abusive husbands or wanting to join the workforce, and while it did isolate a lot of marginalized women—women of color and queer women—sharing those experiences was the fundamental part of consciousness-raising. It was about saying that these problems were not individual, but systemic. So, no it’s not quite activism but it’s useful for shaping conversations.</p>
<p><strong>NB: Any particular hashtag you enjoyed watching unfold?</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13.3333339691162px; line-height: 20.0063056945801px;">DZ: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23YesAllWomen&amp;src=tyah">#YesAllWomen</a>! I actually created a Tumblr called <a href="http://whenwomenrefuse.tumblr.com/">When Women Refuse</a> that accepted submissions of what happens to women when they refuse a man in a relationship, or sexually. That, combined with #YesAllWomen, actually made me see tons of men commenting and linking to it and saying, “I had no idea it was this bad.” So, for all the trolling that happens, there is an actual shift in consciousness. It inspired a number of men that I know to start a men’s-only conversation, about changing masculinity in their daily lives.</p>
<p>I really believe that all of this digital stuff can be used in powerful, wonderful ways. We’re being called in this moment to become much more aware of our surroundings and much more aware of ourselves.</p>

In all these cases, the appeals court had overturned the state's ban, and now same-sex marriages are legal not only in those states, but also soon in the six other states covered by the 4th, 7th, and 10th Circuits (Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, West Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina). </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-e703-4642-7729-462786870056">Like many other people, I've already </span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/10/06/legal-argument-over-gay-marriage-is-all-but-over/">written today</a> that the legal argument over marriage equality is now all but over. The way it presumably will play out from this point forward is that one of the more conservative circuit courts will issue a ruling upholding a state ban on same-sex marriage, and the Supreme Court, presented with this conflict between circuits, will take the case to settle it. And in the wake of today's ruling, it's hard to see how they (and by "they" I mean Anthony Kennedy) would rule that state bans are in fact constitutional, when they just effectively overturned bans in 11 states. (If you're looking for a primer on what happened today, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/10/6/6870087/supreme-court-gay-marriage-equality-decision">this one from Vox</a> is good.)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-e703-4642-7729-462786870056"><span class="pullquote-left">But there is one scenario by which what today seems like an inevitable forward movement for marriage equality could be undone</span>, and it may be the only hope conservatives have left. It involves a Republican winning the White House in 2016 and a liberal justice retiring, to be replaced by a conservative.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-e703-4642-7729-462786870056">This isn't some remote possibility. We have no idea what the election of 2016 will be like, and while as a liberal you probably think that the current crop of Republican contenders are a bunch of bozos, people thought that about any number of people who ended up winning the White House (see Bush, George W.). As of now, Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 81, Stephen Breyer is 76, Sonia Sotomayor is 60, and Elena Kagan is 54. Any one of them could retire for any number of reasons. And once President Rand Paul appoints Ted Cruz to take that retiree's place, things look very different.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-af81cf80-e703-4642-7729-462786870056">Of course, it's possible that, now with 30 states plus D.C. having marriage equality, and who knows how many gay couples even in some very conservative places like Utah and South Carolina getting married, even a future conservative majority on the Court might decline to turn back the clock. It's also possible that a Democrat will win in 2016, or that there will be no retirements from the liberals until the next Democratic presidency. I also think that within a few years, even Republican-appointed justices are going to have to pledge to uphold marriage equality—though they may move through a phase of </span><a href="http://prospect.org/article/when-every-supreme-court-justice-argued-they-might-be-pro-choice">strategic obfuscation</a> as they have on abortion. But even though today's rulings are an incredibly big deal and progress toward marriage equality in every state may be inexorable, there's at least one more hurdle that needs to be overcome.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he debut of a new iPhone is always big news, but this time it’s surrounded by unusual controversy. That’s because the iPhone6 automatically encrypts the phone’s contents. Decrypting requires a code that the user sets and does not share with Apple—which means that, if the FBI orders Apple to turn over data kept on the customer’s phone, the company will produce data that amount to “gibberish” (as the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/technology/iphone-locks-out-the-nsa-signaling-a-post-snowden-era-.html?_r=0">reported</a>).  The FBI then will have to decrypt the data—a process that could take years—or try to compel the user to reveal the code. </p>
<p>FBI director James Comey <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/420160593748455390db7aeaf0abafdc/fbi-chief-new-phone-encryption-could-cost-lives">responded</a> with outrage, claiming that companies like Apple are “marketing something expressly to allow people to hold themselves beyond the law.” Other law enforcement officials have made similar pronouncements. Yet the law doesn’t give the government any right to the contents of your phone. It’s more accurate to say that, in recent years, the advent of widespread third-party data storage has allowed the government to get around the protections afforded by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution. Apple’s encrypted iPhone 6 is just the latest in a series of efforts by the courts and the public to reassert those protections.</p>
<h3>The government’s rights</h3>
<p>The reaction of law enforcement officials to the iPhone6 suggests that encryption interferes with a governmental right of access to a smartphone’s contents. No law, however, prohibits people from using strong encryption for their communications, just as no law prohibits people from deleting them. Both actions, in theory, could frustrate the execution of a warrant, but both clearly have legitimate purposes as well, and the law permits them.</p>
<p>Nor does the law require Apple to keep a key to its customers’ locks. A 1994 <a href="http://www.subsentio.com/live/files/9813/5155/2108/CALEA_Act_of_1994.pdf">statute</a>, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), required telecommunications companies to create “back doors” into their systems to ensure the companies’ ability to comply with wiretap orders. But CALEA was limited in its reach and focused on then-existing technologies. Mandating companies’ ability to decrypt a smartphone would require amending the law, and Edward Snowden’s disclosures derailed recent efforts to do just that. <span class="pullquote-right">At bottom, the rule that Comey is blaming Apple for flouting doesn’t exist</span>—because Congress chose not to adopt it.</p>
<p>(There are good reasons not to expand CALEA, in any event. Experts <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/cmts_voip111505.pdf">note</a> that requiring companies to be able to override security protections means building vulnerabilities into their systems, which also can be exploited by hackers and criminals. On balance, they <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2014/09/securing-phones-and-securing-us/">argue</a>, these “back doors” are a net loss for the public’s safety and security.)</p>
<p>The applicable law here is not CALEA, but the law of supply and demand—and the U.S. government has itself to blame for the outcome. The rising demand for encryption is largely a response to revelations about U.S. surveillance practices, such as adopting tortured interpretations of the law to justify <a href="http://www.pclob.gov/SiteAssets/Pages/default/PCLOB-Report-on-the-Telephone-Records-Program.pdf">collecting</a> the phone and internet metadata of all Americans; covertly undermining security features by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/12/29/report-nsa-intercepts-computer-deliveries/4244181/">intercepting</a> shipments of computers to insert vulnerabilities and <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/the-nsas-secret-campaign-to-crack-undermine-internet-encryption">weakening</a> international encryption standards; and launching a program to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-surveillance-program-reaches-into-the-past-to-retrieve-replay-phone-calls/2014/03/18/226d2646-ade9-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html">collect</a> <em>every</em> phone call going in and out of certain foreign countries. In short, customers have no confidence that the U.S. government will respect the privacy of law-abiding individuals and limit itself to narrow searches for evidence of crimes.</p>
<h3>The people’s rights </h3>
<p>With only narrow exceptions, the Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from accessing Americans’ personal communications and correspondence without a warrant based on probable cause of criminal activity. However, the government, until now, has managed to persuade courts that users forfeit any reasonable expectation of privacy (and thus any Fourth Amendment protection) in information stored on a company’s server or otherwise “shared” with providers. Although Congress enacted some <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703">protections</a> for stored data, they generally fall far below the protections afforded by a regular warrant. The so-called “<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/">third-party doctrine</a>” gives the government relatively easy access to troves of e-mails, text messages, calendars, contact lists, and other private information.</p>
<p>The tide may be turning. In <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/10-1259.pdf"><em>United States v.</em> <em>Jones</em></a>, a 2012 Supreme Court case holding that police officers violated the Fourth Amendment when they attached a GPS device to a car without a warrant, Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested that the Court might need to revisit the third-party doctrine. More recently, in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-132_8l9c.pdf"><em>Riley v. California</em></a>, the Court unanimously ruled that police officers need a warrant to search a cell phone incident to arrest.</p>
<p>But even if a warrant requirement becomes standard for private information held by third parties, reliance on electronic data storage will continue to change how Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights play out. For most of this country’s history, the medium for private correspondence was paper, which could readily be destroyed. Then came telephone calls, which were ephemeral; absent a contemporaneous wiretap, their contents were beyond the reach of law enforcement. People had the ability, in other words, to erase the information they created or received. The only way for law enforcement officials to obtain that information was by convincing the communicants to tell them what they knew—and the Fifth Amendment prohibited officials from compelling statements that would be self-incriminating.</p>
<p>Today, regardless of a person’s wishes, the most common forms of communication—e-mails and text messages—create a semi-permanent record. Even if the information’s creator or recipient tries to delete it, it is often retrievable, either from the provider or through forensic examination of digital storage. The ability to keep one’s information to oneself—the heart of the Fifth Amendment as well as the Fourth—has been sharply curtailed.</p>
<p>Of course, some might celebrate the fact that technology has eroded the ability to destroy evidence. But that would miss the point. <span class="pullquote-left">The legitimate activities that people might reasonably want to keep private dwarf the illegitimate ones</span>, and people have always discarded information for a wide range of reasons. Third-party data storage not only makes it harder to destroy evidence of a crime; it also makes it harder to prevent information theft, to achieve peace of mind that sensitive personal information is inaccessible to others, to reinvent oneself, and to guard against government overreach and abuse. The ability to encrypt data restores the control over personal information that is the hallmark of the right to privacy. </p>
<h3>The practical effect </h3>
<p>The constitutional and legal issues presented by companies’ encryption of smartphones don’t turn on how law enforcement efforts are affected. It’s nonetheless worth noting that the doomsday scenarios invoked by officials—in which the government is helpless to stop an imminent terrorist attack because the critical information lies, encrypted, on the terrorist’s iPhone—are highly unlikely to materialize.</p>
<p>For one thing, much of the data will be accessible through other means. The most important information sought by law enforcement is often metadata—information about a person’s communications, including location, time, and numbers called. These records also are held by mobile phone network operators, out of users’ control. As for the content, most people store their data in multiple places, synching their smartphones with other devices and/or backing up their information in the cloud. Such information will remain available to law enforcement through the other places where it is stored.</p>
<p>In a situation in which the phone is truly the only repository of the information, the government may be able to get a warrant compelling the user to reveal his or her decryption code. One federal appeals court has <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/ca11/201112268.pdf">held</a> that requiring someone to divulge a password violates the Fifth Amendment’s protection against self-incrimination. Federal <a href="http://www.volokh.com/files/BoucherDCT.1.pdf">trial</a> <a href="http://www.internetcases.com/library/cases/2012-01-23-us_v_fricosu.pdf">courts</a>, however, as well as <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/massachusetts/supreme-court/2014/sjc-11358.html">state courts</a>, have upheld such warrants. Criminal suspects who do not comply with orders to disclose their codes may be imprisoned until they do—a strong incentive for compliance.</p>
<p>Of course, terrorists or others bent on wreaking destruction might refuse to supply the code. If above-board methods don’t work (and even if they do), the government may try to do what it has done successfully in the past: hack its way in.  As any computer user knows, there’s no such thing as mistake-free software. The government is adept at finding these vulnerabilities and exploiting them.</p>
<p>In any event, the notion that Apple is providing terrorists with a new way to hide their plans ignores an obvious reality: Any terrorist sophisticated enough to pull off an attack already was encrypting his communications. There are a number of strong cryptography tools that are available, for which only the user possesses the key. Indeed, the Android mobile operating system has offered device-level encryption as an option since 2011 (and <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/google-to-encrypt-data-by-default-on-new-version-of-android/">will soon offer it as the default</a>). Apple did not invent powerful encryption; Apple simply decided to make it a default feature on the iPhone without undermining it by building a back door.</p>
<p>Why, then, is Comey so upset? Apple’s move won’t lead to terrorist attacks or unsolved kidnappings, but it will make FBI investigators’ jobs a bit harder. They would no doubt prefer the one-stop shopping iPhones previously provided.</p>
<p>The source of Comey’s pique, however, probably runs deeper. In the digital age, privacy was starting to feel like a thing of the past. The third-party doctrine and electronic data storage had all but eliminated the need for traditional warrants, and Americans seemed unfazed by the government’s easy access. But the landscape is shifting. Courts are beginning to see the need to revitalize the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and private citizens around the world, galvanized by Snowden’s disclosures, are no longer content to let the U.S. intelligence establishment help itself.  For officials who have come to see mass collection as the government’s own inalienable right, the new iPhone is a stark signal that the days of unfettered governmental access to private information may be numbered.</p>
