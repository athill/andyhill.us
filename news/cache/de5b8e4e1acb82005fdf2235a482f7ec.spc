In front of a camera, he's all suave effrontery, but plunk him down behind one and his cockiness goes out the window. Since Clooney minus his cockiness is the approximate equivalent of Joe Biden with laryngitis, you find yourself wondering which long-gone high-school teacher he's wanly hoping to impress.</p>
<p>If the overrated <em>Goodnight, And Good Luck </em>and the forgettable, forgotten <em>The Ides of March </em>were Clooney in civics class, <em>The Monuments Men </em>is a dose of World Civ combined with art history combined with nostalgia for the jaunty, "Let's put a ragtag bunch of misfits together and go on a mission" WWII movies of his (and my) youth.  Predictably, the last of these is viewers' best chance of getting some driblets of fun out of watching the thing, thanks to a very juicy cast: Bill Murray, John Goodman, Bob Babalan, <em>Downton Abbey</em>'s Hugh Bonneville and <em>The Artist </em>MVP Jean Dujardin, along with Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Clooney himself. With varying degrees of implausibility, they're all impersonating art historians tasked with preserving Europe's cultural heritage from destruction as Patton's vengeful tanks blow the rest of the continent to smithereens.</p>
<p>Clooney plays Frank Stokes, a humble but determined scholar—yeah, sure, George—who convinces President Franklin D. Roosevelt that we'd better look to our Picassos while the contending armies are vying to outdo <em>Guernica. </em>(In a weird throwback to the pieties of 1940s movies, FDR—and, later, Harry Truman, not to mention Hitler—are photographed as if it's somehow unseemly to show their faces.) Then Stokes starts getting his aesthete band of brothers together, and soon they're all in Europe, landing in the war-torn middle of a serious case of <em>Saving Private Ryan </em>envy. But since Clooney doesn't know how to use scale expressively—not even to highlight the contrast between the massive forces blowing everything up and the puny band of art mavens bent on salvaging what they can—the costly re-creations of wrecked cities, Allied columns on the march, and so on just sit on the screen like refugees from another movie entirely.</p>
<p>The script—by Clooney and his frequent collaborator Grant  Heslov—is uncommonly dithering. You keep waiting for idle bits like the repeated joke about Damon's lousy French to add up to some sort of payoff. Then you catch on that these vague scenes in search of a point are going to be the whole movie. Clooney's sense of tempo is so slack that he can't even generate any urgency as everyone takes off to different destinations to track down the cultural treasures the Nazis have looted. </p>
<p>As a French art curator who's suspicious of the team's motives, Cate Blanchett is probably the worst- served cast member, because her character's behavior never does make much sense. (Even the German officer she's got the goods on as an art pilferer ends up getting caught by complete coincidence, without any use of her info.) Still, Blanchett  manages to give the movie some welcome astringency, at least until she's undone by an idiot sequence in which she turns would-be seductress out of the blue  to try wooing Damon into bed.</p>
<p>A few of the actors do pull off nice moments: Murray clowning around to get thin-skinned Babalan's goat, for instance, or cranky old Goodman's developing camaraderie with Dujardin (whose megawatt smile, as always—deployable in any context—is one of the wonders of today's movies). But we don't get the <em>Great Escape</em>-style pleasure of seeing the team's members put their various specialties to use—heck, we can't even be positive what their specialties <em>are—</em>and we never believe in the passion for art that's their supposed common bond. Even Clooney's over-compensating big speeches about the importance of capital-C Culture fall, so to speak, on deaf eyes. From the baffled-looking way he photographs the precious artworks everybody's after, it's as if he wants to impress us with how valuable they are without being able to provide a clue why that's so.</p>
<p>Honestly, who on earth thought <em>The Monuments Men </em>was a good idea for a movie? Clooney and Heslov keep tossing in increasingly random ingredients, from Murray listening to his wife croon "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" during the otherwise irrelevant Battle of the Bulge to a race with the Russians for the final treasure trove and a diversionary vignette that has Eisenhower, Patton, and Bradley all showing up to marvel at a discovered stash of gold bullion rather than the art that's also been rescued, which is unfair to Ike. His no-uncertain-terms directive was what forced the army to take the real Monuments Men seriously.</p>
<p>It's fairly plain that nobody involved ever did figure out what, if anything, the material added up to that might hold an audience's interest. (No surprise that the Holocaust gets belatedly dragged in as a sort of guest Star of David; the loss of their art collections was hardly the worst of what Europe's Jews faced, but the movie could give you a different impression.) If you ask me, the definitive WWII flick on the "Is art worth dying for?" theme is still 1964's <em>The Train, </em>and not because either director John Frankenheimer or star Burt Lancaster came up with a good answer to that ultimate eye-of-the-beholder question. Realizing that a) they didn't have a clue and b) most moviegoers couldn't care less, they just set out to give audiences a rip-roaring good time. </p>

Now, in <em>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</em>, journalist Elizabeth Kolbert eulogizes the decline of a handful of species and makes the case that a new mass die-off is under way. Industrial processes that pump carbon dioxide into the ocean are making life untenable for the thousands of plants and creatures that live in its depths, especially the vast but fragile coral reefs. Whole populations of bats in the northeastern United States have been decimated by a fungus brought to New England by an unsuspecting European traveler. The great auk, an extinct bird, suffered its last stand on an Icelandic island after being relentlessly hunted for just a few decades.</p>
<p>By the end of the 21st century, scientists estimate that half of the world’s biodiversity will be gone. This extermination, which has the potential to be the most cataclysmic, is almost entirely driven by humans. The beginning of the sixth extinction coincided with the first traces of human life—we caused it, and we may fall victim to it as well.</p>
<p>Bill McKibben, a writer and the founder of 350.org, a global organizing effort to curb the advance of climate change, has argued for more than 20 years that we are approaching an environmental point of no return. In a series of best-selling books, McKibben has warned that if humanity is to survive, we must recognize that climate change is gradually making the planet uninhabitable.</p>
<p>In this installment of “The Conversation,” a new <em>Prospect</em> feature, Kolbert and McKibben discuss the scope of the sixth extinction and grapple with why raising awareness about environmental catastrophe is so difficult. Their exchange has been edited for concision and clarity. <em>—Amelia Thomson-Deveaux</em></p>

<p><strong>Bill McKibben: </strong>Of all the things I found to be haunting in the book, the one that most stood out to me was your description of walking out along the Great Barrier Reef in the darkness. What did it feel like?<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Kolbert:</strong> That was an amazing experience, which is ironic—in reporting a book that’s just chock-full of bad news about the world, I got to go to the most spectacular, unspoiled places on the planet. One of these, as you mentioned, was a tiny island on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef. I was on this island because a team was doing research there on ocean acidification. They had a buoy out on the reef flat, where they’d collect samples. When you are out there at night and there is no horizon, there is nothing but blackness and amazing stars and your flashlight. There are animals lurking in these pools waiting for the tide to come back in so they can swim out. Enormous turtles, octopuses, these giant clams that leer at you with lurid, vividly colored lips.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>That’s such foreign fauna, especially for those of us who live in the mountains in the eastern United States. Did you have a sort of Jacques Cousteau reaction—“I love everything around me”—or is your appreciation of this kind of biodiversity more intellectual?</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span><span class="pullquote-right">I think the alienness of that underwater world prevents us from appreciating what we are doing to the oceans, which is in some ways even more serious than what we are doing to the land.</span> By pouring carbon dioxide into the ocean, we are doing something that may never have happened before. It has no analogue in the geological record because we are doing it so fast, acidifying the water at such an extreme rate. But we are very much land creatures, so we don’t appreciate this amazing underwater realm, and we’re not aware of what we’re doing to it.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>You were one of the first people outside the world of science to understand the full implications of ocean acidification. Do you think of us as living on a kind of ocean planet now? </p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>It’s difficult to exaggerate the significance of the oceans. If you have ever brought home a piece of coral from a trip to the Caribbean, you can imagine that if you put that in a jar of vinegar, it would dissolve. That’s an extreme example, because vinegar is very acidic, but you can imagine that long before you get to the point where coral dissolves, it becomes difficult for the coral to do its job. We are making it hard for these organisms to do what they are evolutionarily programmed to do and have been doing for hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>The hallmark of evolutionary biology is adaptability. Is the main thing that’s different in this era the speed with which we are forcing things to adapt? Is that the single biggest new variable in this new system?</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>I once got this question from a person who said, <span class="pullquote">“Well, if things start going extinct, won’t new things just evolve?”</span> It was like extinction and evolution were a one-for-one trade. But the answer is that you can drive things extinct quickly, but it is very difficult to speed up evolution. If we were driving these changes at a pace that’s hundreds, even a million times slower, then yes, maybe most things would adapt to that, and we would get a very different world but not necessarily a humongous wave of extinctions. But otherwise you can do the math yourself.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>And in this case, we are talking about an equation where we’re not even close. It’s not like we are going twice as fast as species can adapt—we are going tens of thousands of times faster.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>There have been moments in the past where the earth has experienced very swift, extreme changes—in a geological sense. And right now, we are in one of those moments. We are causing changes so fast that in the span of a human lifetime or a couple of human lifetimes, you can watch them happening. So part of the question for who will survive and who won’t is how fast generations are produced. If you are a microbe, you might do a lot better than an insect, which may do a lot better than a mammal. Big mammals are in serious trouble.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>In Vermont where I live, we are watching the moose, which are my favorites of all the northern mammals, being decimated.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>Why is that?</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>The single biggest problem is temperature change. Moose don’t like heat to begin with—any time it gets above 20 degrees, they’ll be looking for shade. But now ticks can live through the winter. So while any given moose generally would have 7,000 or 8,000 ticks on it, now they are finding them with 100,000 ticks. And they just can’t deal with it. The number of moose dropped by 50 percent in five years across much of the northern part of North America.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>You also live near the epicenter of what’s happening to bats. Someone—almost certainly inadvertently—brought over a fungus that is killing off the little brown bat. One of the most ubiquitous animals in the Northeast is now listed as an endangered species in Vermont.</p>
<p>I visited a cave that used to be the biggest bat hibernaculum in the Northeast, with hundreds of thousands of bats. It’s now almost completely empty. One year I visited, and there were dead bats all over the ground, you couldn’t walk without stepping on them, and now it’s just this black, rich muck, which is their decomposed bodies, and these tiny little toothpick-like bones everywhere, a carpet of these bones. That’s what’s left of this incredible bat population.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>It doesn’t sound like adaptation is going to happen in the time frame we have.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>What’s happening with the little brown bat is a case where we accidentally brought together these evolutionary lineages that have been separated for a long time, with disastrous results. Often we bring new species together and they coexist, they muddle along, but if we keep doing it over and over again, then sometimes the consequences will be bad.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>Another thing that is amazing to me is to watch things that we utterly depend on just stop working. Corn won’t tassel. It won’t set seed if it’s 95 degrees outside. It’s even affecting us. There’s a new study that says the human ability to perform outdoor work has already dropped 10 percent due to an increase in heat and humidity. It’ll be 20 percent by midcentury.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>Different organisms have different physiological heat tolerance. One scientist whom I talked with who’s studying climate change explains that all of these species near the equator are on the move—they’re going upslope, toward the poles. But in the Amazon lowlands, where the temperatures are consistently among the highest on Earth, what’s going to move in there? <span class="pullquote-left">We’re radically changing what is now the most biodiverse part of the world.</span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>But on the other hand, there are things that do extraordinarily well in the simplified world that we’re creating.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>Wherever you have sunlight and nutrients, something will be able to survive. There’s a lot of versatility, but it won’t be what was there before, and that will have an effect of its own. Some things will do really well and some things may surprise us. We’re in uncharted territory, but we seem hell-bent on finding out what a simplified world will look like. And that’s a question I’ve got for you—what does motivate us to take action, to reverse this process as best we can? What gets people to make that step?</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>That’s an interesting question to think about in terms of evolutionary biology. One would think that if our big brain were equipped to get us into this kind of trouble, it would come up with something to get us out of it.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>But evolution is such a random process—it probably didn’t work that way.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>OK, so the hope is not that the brain is going to get us out of this mess but that maybe the human heart can. We have to hope that there is something in our culture that evolved, not biologically but culturally over time, that lets us have enough concern and compassion for the rest of creation, for things deep into the future, generations to come. But although there are lots of people engaged, there are also a very few fighting to maintain the current system as it is, who have so much money that their small numbers are offset by the size of their wallets. When you were reporting this, how did you manage to keep any sort of equanimity? You’re basically describing an impending apocalypse. <span class="pullquote">What is the proper state of mind in which to contemplate an apocalypse?</span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>I get asked that question all the time, and my answer is always that I don’t have a good answer. For the people involved in this research, in some ways this is a fascinating and exciting time. You’re watching natural phenomena that we should not be able to watch. But many of them are despairing. Someone told me about a party for a famous conservation biologist where they gave out party favors—things they use in the field like duct tape, rope, a bottle of rum—and someone suggested that they also give out a razor blade to slit their wrists because everything that’s happening in conservation biology is so depressing. People have already asked me what the hopeful part of my book will be, and my only answer is that it’s not there.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>What I keep finding is that these twin problems—climate change and ocean acidification—are so huge that people feel a lack of agency. They think to themselves, it’s too big, there’s nothing I can do about it, which is certainly true in an individual sense. We have been getting unremittingly bad news for 25 years, and it keeps getting worse than the scientists thought it was going to be. Have you found that scientists in this realm—who have generally been quite conservative in their estimates and unwilling to speak out much—are so shocked by what they are seeing that they’re becoming more aggressive about letting people know?</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>If you read the scientific literature, there is relentless talk about the “current mass extinction.” We have sophisticated ways of looking back through geological history and trying to tease out what the planet was like hundreds of millions of years ago, and in that context, in that sweep of history, what we are doing is so unusual. It becomes more unusual the further back you look. And if we continue on our merry path, we are going to create a level of ocean acidification that probably has not been witnessed on this earth for hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">McKibben: </strong>It’s a pretty remarkable thing to have done in a few dozen years and on a small portion of the globe.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Kolbert:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>It’s remarkable for having been unintentional. But now we do know what the consequences of our literally earth-changing actions have been. <span class="pullquote-right">That is the burden of our time, that burden of knowledge.

Who wants the old and tired, when you can get with the fresh, the happening, the now? But as in love, the intoxicating rush of discovery lasts only so long, and then you really have to bring the goods. Which is why exciting new candidates like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama became president, and exciting new candidates like Gary Hart and Howard Dean didn't.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the bigfoot of the 2016 race, one Hillary Rodham Clinton, with whom you might have a passing familiarity. Seth Masket (responding to <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/02/if-hillary-runs-what-exactly-will-she-run">Kevin Drum</a>) <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/ten-miles-square/2014/02/are_people_already_tired_of_hi048956.php">makes a pretty strong case</a> that the idea that we get tired of public figures is basically a myth. "Is there any evidence that voters 'get tired' of politicians? I don't want to get into the whole literature on what governs presidential elections, but the simple answer is no." He goes over a bunch of examples, noting that where an oldster like Bob Dole lost, it was always because of things that had nothing to do with the fact that they'd been on the scene for decades and people were bored with them.</p>
<p>I'd have to agree. The next time somebody tells you, "Ach, I'm just so tired of Hillary Clinton. Can't we have somebody new?", you might want to ask them whether they ever liked her in the first place. I'm guessing it would be hard to find too many people who used to just love her, but now feel like they're tired of her. I don't mean people who changed their mind about her based on some specific incident or issue, but for no reason other than the fact that she's been around a long time. Or think about it this way: you probably feel differently about Barack Obama than you did round about six years ago. But is that because he's just been on your teevee too much, or are there more particular reasons?</p>
<p>I don't doubt that in the coming two years, pundits will suggest many times that people are tired of Hillary Clinton. When you hear that, ask who it is that's really tired of her, and whether that just means they never liked her anyway.</p>

Last week, at a New York State Bar event, Deputy Attorney General James Cole <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2014/01/30/White-House-seeks-candidates-for-clemency-in-drug-cases/UPI-53121391114390/">announced</a> that there may be more—many more. The administration, he said, will seek other drug cases to consider for clemency, working with the Bureau of Prisons to encourage inmates to request commutations and asking that state bar associations help with preparing their petitions.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">After five years of organizing and lobbying the president to use his pardoning power for thousands still jailed under draconian sentences for crack, you might have expected the news to have clemency advocates jumping for joy. But they responded with well-worn skepticism. On his widely read blog, Sentencing Law and Policy, Ohio State law professor Doug Berman speculated that Obama's actions were more about holiday traditions than new presidential priorities. Even after Cole’s speech, Mark Osler, a law professor at St. Thomas University in Minneapolis and the creator of the country’s first clemency clinic, argued in </span><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/only-half-way-there-mercy" style="line-height: 1.538em;">a piece for MSNBC</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> that without a plan for dealing with the influx of petitions, the administration was “only halfway there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Osler has a point: Obama officials already have 3,500 petitions sitting on their desks, awaiting a response. The problem isn't that prisoners aren’t asking—it’s that the administration isn't responding.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Obama remains the stingiest president </span><a href="http://www.justice.gov/pardon/statistics.htm" style="line-height: 1.538em;">in history</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> with pardons and commutations. Given the sullied recent history of presidential pardons, that's probably no surprise. Presidential pardons and commutations have been awkward, messy affairs in the last two administrations. Bill Clinton’s exit from the White House was indelibly marred when he granted clemency to tax evader (and husband to a big Democratic donor) Marc Rich. George W. Bush found himself in hot water when he commuted the sentence of former vice-presidential adviser Scooter Libby, who was convicted for his role in outing Valerie Plame as a spy</span><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;"><em>. </em></strong><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Pardons are almost always met with some skepticism since, by definition, the president is letting someone off the hook early or giving them a second chance.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">But the political risk of granting clemency to long-serving drug offenders had already lessened considerably by the time Obama took office. Over the four years before he moved into the White House, the U.S. Supreme Court made a series of decisions that dismantled many of the War on Drugs sentencing policies in general, and crack sentencing in particular. After the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 decreed that a gram of crack would be treated like 100 grams of powder cocaine, hundreds of thousands of predominantly black defendants received lengthy sentences for using or dealing crack. Additional laws ramped up the sentences, giving defendants extra time for gun possession, prior convictions, and other factors. The federal government began investing in law-enforcement strategies that often led to conspiracy charges, in which everyone involved in a drug scheme would get charged with the total amount of drugs dealt. According to the pro-reform group Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Department of Justice spends </span><a href="http://famm.org/the-facts/#thecost" style="line-height: 1.538em;">one out of four dollars</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> keeping drug offenders, most of whom are nonviolent, in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The Supreme Court ruled against the 100-to-1 ratio in 2007. The same day Obama was inaugurated, the Court ruled that judges could use other ratios they deemed more appropriate. In 2010, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act, moving the crack-cocaine disparity down to 18-to-1—not the 1-to-1 ratio that activists wanted, but still much closer.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The rulings and the new law weren’t universally retroactive, though, and nearly 9,000 inmates are still serving sentences meted out under the old regime. Obama had talked in his campaign about unfair crack-cocaine disparities, lending hope to advocates for the thousands still jailed under policies now deemed unfair—and to those seeking commutations. But no action was forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Five years later, encouraging more people to seek a pardon is a welcome gesture. But what will it yield? “The problem is that the process doesn’t work,” writes Osler. “The pipeline is clogged, and the solution can’t be simply to jam more things into it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">So what </span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">is</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> a possible solution? Believe it or not, many activists think it involves rewinding back to the '70s, to the Gerald Ford administration. Osler and organizers like Nkechi Taifa, a senior policy analyst for civil and criminal justice reform at the Open Society Foundations, have proposed the creation of a clemency board similar to the one Ford used to deal with Vietnam draft-dodging cases. That board handled 21,000 clemency petitions in just one year, granting 90 percent of the petitioners some form of clemency, from immediate pardon to two years of alternative national service. Osler, whom I'm profiling for the next print issue of </span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">The Prospect</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, details his proposal </span><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2053619" style="line-height: 1.538em;">here.</a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The Ford model would make it easier to deal with cases that don’t pull at the heart strings. Pardoning the most sympathetic cases—the girlfriend who took the fall for her boyfriend, the guy who was just the lookout for a drug deal—is politically appealing. But a board structure makes it easier to handle the many, many more cases of people who may have been clearly guilty but still didn’t deserve to spend half of their life in prison. By the same token, Ford’s boards made it easier to give draft-dodgers more just sentences; they considered each application individually, but the sheer number of cases meant that the media and public didn't—</span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">couldn't</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">—scrutinize each pardon individually. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The political winds have shifted enough in recent years that clemency for crack offenses would hardly cause a fuss. In one sign of the change, Republican Senator Mike Lee co-sponsored the Smarter Sentencing Act last summer with Democratic Senator Dick Durbin. In addition to reducing mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders, the measure would allow the thousands in prison for crack crimes under the old 100-to-1 regime to return to court for a new hearing. The bill just passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support. The conservative Heritage Foundation has </span><a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2014/01/31/time-reconsider-mandatory-minimum-sentences/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">lent support</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> to the cause. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">If Obama sets up a Ford-style system for dealing with pardons, it will mean more than extending justice to those who have been serving overly harsh sentences. It could also help redeem a presidential power that for too long has been associated with political favors, and restore its role as a tool for justice.</span></p>

The mainstream media only had a few moments to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-kessler/keystone-review_b_4714156.html">glance</a> at the executive summary—the report itself is an un-skimmable eleven volumes long—before the news cycle moved onto the big game. </p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">But if you live or work in Washington, D.C., and take the </span><a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/canada-makes-keystone-xl-ad-blitz-metro-stations-152316305.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">Metro</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, you may well have been assailed for months by Canada's </span><a href="http://grist.org/news/canadas-government-is-spending-millions-to-get-you-to-like-the-keystone-pipeline/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">multi-million dollar</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> advertising blitz promoting the pipeline. Commuters are being treated to homey images of happy little girls poking their heads out from behind the American and Canadian flags, side by side, and to awkward slogans like "America and Canada: Standing together for energy independence." </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The commuters the ads are targeted at are the people involved in deciding whether to approve TransCanada Corporation's application to build a pipeline that would carry up to 830,000 barrels of per day of </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/opinion/the-dangers-of-diluted-bitumen-oil.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">diluted tar sands bitumen</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> 1,179 miles from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. The thick, dirty oil would then enter the 487-mile southern portion of the pipeline, rebranded the "Gulf Coast Pipeline Project," to refineries that can handle the heavy crude in Texas and Louisiana; that southerly pipeline </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/01/22/265076621/keystone-pipeline-s-southern-section-begins-delivering-oil-to-gulf-coast" style="line-height: 1.538em;">started flowing</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> last month. Now that State has completed its environmental impact report (known by the bureaucratic colloquialism </span><a href="http://www.keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">SEIS</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">), the ball has been passed to eight federal agencies that now have 90 days to comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Among them are the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Energy, and Justice. These agencies will obviously consider how the pipeline might relate to America's desire for energy security.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Perhaps less obviously, they will also consider the pipeline's relationship to climate change, which each agency has officially identified as a major threat to American security. In their 2010 quadrennial reviews, </span><a href="http://www.defense.gov/qdr/images/QDR_as_of_12Feb10_1000.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">DoD</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> stated that climate change "may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict," and </span><a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/qhsr_report.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">DHS</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> said that:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Dependence on fossil fuels and the threat of global climate change … can open the United States to disruptions and manipulations in energy supplies and to changes in our natural environment on an unprecedented scale. Climate change is expected to increase the severity and frequency of weather-related hazards, which could, in turn, result in social and political destabilization, international conflict, or mass migrations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://energy.gov/downloads/us-energy-sector-vulnerabilities-climate-change-and-extreme-weather">DoE</a> sees climate change as a major risk to America's energy sector, and DOJ, by way of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/as-eco-terrorism-wanes-governments-still-target-activist-groups-seen-as-threat/2012/02/28/gIQAA4Ay3R_story.html">FBI</a>, sees eco-terrorism as a top cause of domestic terrorism.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Climate change and energy insecurity will—or at least should—be the top concerns for the officials at these four departments who are considering the pipeline. To help them perform a rigorous review, here are a few things that these officials should keep in mind.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">First, Be Skeptical</strong></h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">There are strong reasons to be dubious of the objectivity of the SEIS. Investigative reporters found several conflicts of interest contractors who were preparing the report had with TransCanada. The first environmental impact statement was prepared by the firm Cardno Entrix, which listed TransCanada </span><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/foia-docs-show-yet-another-conflict-of-interest-in-keystone" style="line-height: 1.538em;">as one of its major clients</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The State Department also contracted work out to Environmental Resources Management Inc. (ERM Group), which </span><a href="http://libcloud.s3.amazonaws.com/93/3f/a/3046/ERM_Backgrounder.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">is closely tied to TransCanada</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">. In fact, it was TransCanada who </span><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/foia-docs-show-yet-another-conflict-of-interest-in-keystone" style="line-height: 1.538em;">recommended ERM</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> to the folks at State. It wouldn't have come as a surprise to TransCanada that ERM has a </span><a href="http://desmogblog.com/2014/01/22/state-dept-keystone-xl-erm-group-ok-alaska-pebble-mine" style="line-height: 1.538em;">record</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> of greenlighting environmentally questionable projects. ERM has worked for TransCanada before and even </span><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/keystone-consultant-lobbied-for-trade-group-linked-to-transcanada-101994.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">lobbied</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> for the company—but on its application to State, it lied and claimed never to have no connections.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">And then it looks like State </span><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/keystone-xl-contractor-ties-transcanada-state-department" style="line-height: 1.538em;">covered up</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> the conflicts.  The department's Inspector General started an investigation, and 24 House Democrats signed a </span><a href="http://grijalva.house.gov/uploads/Grijalva%20Letter%20to%20Obama%20on%20Keystone%20Conflicts%20of%20Interest%20Dec.%2012.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">letter</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> asking President Obama not to let State release the final SEIS until the Inspector General's investigation was finished and made public. That didn't happen.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Who Actually Gets the Oil?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The first pillar of energy security is stable access to adequate energy supplies in order to meet U.S. demand. Will the pipeline help?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The pipeline's advocates make it sound like all of the additional Canadian tar sands oil that would flow through Keystone XL would end up in the tanks of American cars. As TransCanada CEO Russ Girling </span><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/22/transcanada-gulfcoast-exports-idUSL2N0KW1NU20140122" style="line-height: 1.538em;">said</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, there was no crude oil that would come out of the pipeline and get re-exported. "I have talked to every one of our customers, both producers and refiners, I've asked them the question again—do you have any intent of shipping any of this crude oil offshore? And the answer is absolutely not."</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">But he's playing a rhetorical trick here: He says "crude" oil. Of course, the </span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">crude</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> oil wouldn't get re-exported; the refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast would </span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">refine</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> it. And once refined—yep, you guessed it—it isn't "crude" oil anymore. At that point, it has been processed into different products, including gasoline, diesel, liquefied natural gas, jet fuels, lubricants, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">So where will those refined products end up? When asked by then-Representative Edward Markey (D-MA) to support a condition that the Canadian tar sands be used in the United States after they're refined, TransCanada's CEO </span><a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/aswift/keystone_xl_is_a_tar_sands_pip.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">balked</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, claiming that such a condition would cause its clients to pull out of their refinery contracts. They've already contracted </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/opinion/say-no-to-the-keystone-xl.html?_r=1&amp;" style="line-height: 1.538em;">three-quarters</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> of the oil to foreign companies or to Valero, an American company whose </span><a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/valero-positioning-export-tar-sands-oil-guarding-pot-gold-end-keystone-xl-pipeline" style="line-height: 1.538em;">internal documents</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span><a href="http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2011/09/OCIkeystoneXL_2011R.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">detail</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> to its investors its plan to export the refined products.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Export beyond the United States is at the core of the Keystone XL strategy. Our northern neighbor is estimated to have the world's second or third greatest quantity of oil reserves, </span><a href="http://www.c2es.org/energy/source/oil/keystone" style="line-height: 1.538em;">97 percent</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> of which are locked in tar sands in Alberta. That is also the percentage exported to the United States, and as Canada's Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver recently </span><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/09/13/pol-oliver-pipeline-oil-exports.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">said</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, "we would like to diversify that." Foreign-government-owned oil companies have already invested tens of billions of dollars in Canadian tar sands, including </span><a href="http://www.eia.gov/countries/analysisbriefs/Canada/canada.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">PetroChina</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> and the </span><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-08/canada-approves-cnooc-petronas-bids-for-nexen-progress-energy.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">. (One assumes this isn't mere financial speculation.) Canada has its eye on Europe as a market for tar sands oil, and so it is </span><a href="http://www.pembina.org/blog/763" style="line-height: 1.538em;">doggedly</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span><a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2013/11/15/oil-sands-industry-fights-back/?__lsa=25fb-6f85" style="line-height: 1.538em;">fighting</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">—with </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/20/trade-representative-tar-sands_n_4482133.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">U.S.</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> and </span><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/19/canada-tar-sands-oil-eu" style="line-height: 1.538em;">U.K.</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> help—the European Union's attempt to pass a Fuel Quality Directive that would rate the relative carbon pollution of different types of transportation fuels to help it reach its 2020 targets; tar sands are considered 25 percent dirtier than conventional oil.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Security from Price Fluctuations?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The second pillar of energy security is financial: maintaining the stability of prices.  Will Keystone XL help or hurt? It's unclear. The estimates range from it </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/10/26/163637629/energy-independence-wouldnt-make-gasoline-any-cheaper" style="line-height: 1.538em;">doing nothing</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> to it </span><a href="http://desmogblog.com/2014/01/24/keystone-xl-could-boost-global-oil-consumption-500k-barrels-year" style="line-height: 1.538em;">lowering prices</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> by raising consumption—and thereby undermining the economics of tar sands production, which are predicated on high worldwide oil prices. Or, the pipeline might raise prices by </span><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/07/16/2307741/approving-the-keystone-pipeline-could-cost-us-consumers-3-4-billion-per-year-in-higher-gas-prices/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">$3-4 billion</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">From Pipeline to Carbon Bomb?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">We have lots of pipelines, so what's the big deal with adding one more? The SEIS tries to make it seem like Keystone XL is just a drop in the bucket, and that Alberta's tar sands oil are going to get to market with or without the pipeline. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">But will it? Keystone boosters say yes, absolutely, a pipeline would just be cheaper and more energy efficient than using trains to transport tar sands. But as energy and security expert Michael T. Klare </span><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175648/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">explains</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, Keystone XL "could determine the fate of the Canadian tar-sands industry." A Canadian pro-tar sands think tank issued a report entitled "</span><a href="http://cwf.ca/publications-1/pipe-or-perish" style="line-height: 1.538em;">Pipe or Perish: Saving an Oil Industry at Risk</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">," which found that "investment and expansion will grind to a halt" without the pipeline. </span><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tom-steyer-letter-to-secretary-kerry-regarding-the-keystone-xl-environmental-impact-statement-243226961.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">Several oil executives</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> and analyses by the </span><a href="http://priceofoil.org/2013/11/12/iea-confirms-tar-sands-pipelines-key-production-growth/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">International Energy Agency</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, </span><a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/aswift/goldman_sachs_report_finds_tha.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">Goldman Sachs</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, </span><a href="http://www.eenews.net/assets/2013/06/10/document_pm_04.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">Toronto-Dominion Bank</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, </span><a href="http://dir.rbcinvestments.com/pictures/account-barnaby.ross/energy%20insights%20-%20rbc%20cm%20-%2002%2011%202013.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">Royal Bank of Canada</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, and </span><a href="https://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Canada/Local%20Assets/Documents/EandR/ca_en_energy_oil_sands_2013_110612.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">Deloitte</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> agree.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">From an energy security standpoint, this might suggest to the federal agency reviewers that the pipeline is a good idea; even if it won't directly help, it will be a catalyst for more tar sands crude making its way into the United States over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">But this is where the climate change question comes up, and it's why ERM and the pipeline's other boosters are trying to make it seem like Keystone XL isn't all that big a deal. By saying that it's going to happen anyway and only discussing the environmental effects of the </span><a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/content/how-deconstruct-difficult-math-keystone-xls-carbon-footprint" style="line-height: 1.538em;">single pipeline</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, they are practicing a bit of misdirection, distracting us from the big question of what a massive expansion of Alberta's tar sands industry would do to the environment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">This is why the pipeline issue has so </span><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/09/16/130916fa_fact_lizza?currentPage=all&amp;mobify=0" style="line-height: 1.538em;">galvanized</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> environmentalists. It is also why the </span><a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/nepa/keystone-xl-project-epa-comment-letter-20130056.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">EPA</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> doubted the validity of the draft SEIS when it was released last year (also at </span><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/03/enviros-attack-latest-state-dept-report-keystone-xl" style="line-height: 1.538em;">4pm on a Friday</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">). The EPA found that it </span><a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/04/23/epa-doubts-state-departments-analysis-of-keystone-xldoes-it-matter" style="line-height: 1.538em;">underestimated negative environmental consequences</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> and that its rail-will-do-the-trick market analysis was seriously flawed. And despite an oft-cited recent report contending that the pipeline won't make much difference (which it turns out was </span><a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/178230/alberta-government-quietly-funded-researchers-behind-independent-report-boosting-keyston" style="line-height: 1.538em;">quietly paid for</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> by the Alberta government), kickstarting what has been called "</span><a href="http://citizenshift.org/node/23128&amp;dossier_nid=22361" style="line-height: 1.538em;">the world's largest industrial project</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">"—Canada aims to </span><a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCATRE7AL2L220111122" style="line-height: 1.538em;">triple</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> or more its production by 2035—would make a huge, dangerous difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">In addition to the </span><a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/mining-tar-sands-produces-much-more-air-pollution-we-thought-180949565/%5D" style="line-height: 1.538em;">high toxicity</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, </span><a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/top-10-facts-canada-alberta-oil-sands-information" style="line-height: 1.538em;">pollution problems</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, and </span><a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/topic/dilbit-disaster-series-2012" style="line-height: 1.538em;">particular spill risks</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">, the relative dirtiness of tar sands oil would cause 17 percent more CO2 (according to the SEIS, though estimates often go higher) to end up in the atmosphere compared to the average gallon of oil in the United States. And that doesn't include the carbon </span><a href="http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/canadas-oil-sands" style="line-height: 1.538em;">sequestered</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> in the forests, wetlands, soil, and other biomass that are torn up to access Albertan tar sands that would also be released into the atmosphere. (On the environmental costs of digging for tar sands oil, the SEIS deferred to the review conducted by the boosterish Canadian government.)</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">But perhaps worst of all is the simple fact that accessing a significant amount of Canadian tar sands oil simply means that the world's growing demand for oil will be fed. Can American security withstand continuing with business as usual over the long term?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Game Over?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The prominent climate scientist </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/opinion/game-over-for-the-climate.html?_r=2&amp;" style="line-height: 1.538em;">James Hansen</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">—a favorite target for attacks by the fossil fuel industries and climate deniers—has famously said that if Keystone XL is approved and if over the long term, high demand and high prices lead to technologies enabling all of Alberta's tar sands to be exploited, "it will be game over for the climate."</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">To understand his scary prediction, it is important to understand the fundamental notion of the world's "carbon budgets." Put simply, we can predict the quantity of greenhouse gases (GHG) we can pump into the atmosphere before warming the earth by an average of 2 degrees centigrade, which is generally seen as the highest safe (if not actually </span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">good</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">) increase. We can also predict how much GHG it will take to warm the atmosphere an average of 4 or 6 degrees centigrade, which would be catastrophic at home and abroad.  Those amounts are the budgets; it's all we can burn; it's as simple as that.  (</span><a href="http://grist.org/climate-change/2011-12-05-the-brutal-logic-of-climate-change/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">Here</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> is a helpful explanation by David Roberts.)</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">To stay within a 2 degree budget, it is widely accepted that the world needs to </span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">reduce</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> its use of fossil fuels, not </span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">increase</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> it. We can only burn </span><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/04/17/1885621/keystone-pipeline-will-create-only-35-permanent-jobs-emit-51-coal-plants-worth-of-carbon/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">one-third</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> of the world's existing, proven fossil fuel reserves. That's a big challenge with rising demand for energy prompted by a growing population and a surge in the number of growing economies.   </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Our Nation's Interest</strong></h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Of course, it might not be so bad.  Industry lobbyists will certainly sneer at such dire predictions. But will they admit that their arguments largely rely on other areas of Canadian life reducing its carbon output, or that Canada has been ranked the </span><a href="https://germanwatch.org/en/download/8599.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">worst overall carbon performer</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> in the developed world? Will they concede that the models have actually </span><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-science-predictions-prove-too-conservative/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">consistently underestimated</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> the ways that the climate has changed so far? Will they confess that their job-creation </span><a href="http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/keystone-xl-will-pipe-energy-and-economic-security-us" style="line-height: 1.538em;">claims</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> are </span><a href="http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/globallaborinstitute/research/keystonexl.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">wildly exaggerated</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> and that even the SEIS states that the completed pipeline would only provide </span><a href="http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221135.pdf" style="line-height: 1.538em;">50</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> permanent jobs?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Last June, President Obama </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/25/obama-keystone_n_3497292.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">said</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> that Keystone XL should only be approved if "doing so would be in our nation's interest … [which] will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution." Our security officials need to be prepared to see through the industry's talking points if they are to conduct an objective and rigorous review of the SEIS. And if they want to take the security ramifications of TransCanada's application and climate change seriously, they will have to seriously consider leaving carbon in the ground.</span></p>

Sandra Fluke <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-pc-sandra-fluke-congress-state-senate-20140205,0,7267538.story#axzz2sYKCkutq">decided</a> to pass on a House race and run for the California state senate instead. Singer Clay Aiken is running in North Carolina, and though the district makes it a tough slog, the guy is about ten times more skilled in front of a camera than your average candidate, as evidenced by his <a href="http://youtu.be/EpePzRPiB30">first ad</a>. Then there's Allan Levene, whose desire to serve his nation is so fervent that he's <a href="http://blogs.rollcall.com/hawkings/republican-hedges-his-bets-by-targeting-house-seats-in-4-states/">running</a> in four different districts in four states, which is apparently perfectly legal.</p>
<p>But the candidate I want to talk about is Ro Khanna, who, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/us/politics/tech-industry-flexes-muscle-in-california-race.html">according to the <em>New York Times</em></a>, is running to be Silicon Valley's man in Washington. The Valley is split between two districts, represented by Anna Eshoo and Mike Honda, two liberal Democrats who have advocated plenty for the tech industry. But Honda's advocacy must not have been enthusiastic enough, because a parade of tech titans including Eric Schmidt, Sheryl Sandberg, Marc Andreessen, and Marissa Mayer, is lining up behind Khanna's primary challenge to the veteran congressman. Khanna has nearly $2 million in cash on hand (three times as much as Honda), and his web site <a href="http://www.rokhanna.com/endorsements">lists</a> hundreds of "technology leaders" who have endorsed him.</p>
<p>Which is perfectly fine—Honda's a good guy, but nobody has a right to keep their seat, and if Khanna beats him fair and square, then more power to him. But I wonder if all the Valley luminaries backing Khanna have illusions about what he might be able to do for them. As the <em>Times</em> says, "Using the jargon of tech start-ups, Mr. Khanna says he will be a 'disruptive' force in Washington." OK, so this is just the tech version of, "I'm going to change the way they do business in Washington!", which is what every congressional challenger says. But it's always baloney, and they never do.</p>
<p>That's because there are 435 members of Congress, and moving into a position of influence requires not just time and work, but the permission of the people above you in the hierarchy. This is particularly true on the Democratic side, where Nancy Pelosi runs an extremely tight ship. Democrats in the House pretty much do what Pelosi tells them, and they all benefit from the system; few of them would want to be part of the kind of Thunderdome free-for-all that characterizes the House Republican caucus these days. Furthermore, it's one thing to gain influence, and another thing entirely to amass so much influence that you can actually change the institution in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>So could Khanna be a disruptive force? Well, there's really only one way to make an immediate impact as a freshman member of Congress, and that's to be an obnoxious loudmouth. You can be an obnoxious loudmouth for good liberal causes, like Alan Grayson did when he first got to Congress, or you can be an obnoxious loudmouth for conservative causes, like Alan West did. Do it loudly and obnoxiously enough, and you can get on cable news a lot and people will learn your name.</p>
<p>But there's nothing particularly "disruptive" about that; feeding the outrage machine doesn't exactly subvert the status quo. So if Ro Khanna gets to Congress, he'll have to be pretty creative if he wants to disrupt things in a positive way. The tech giants who are behind him probably shouldn't get their hopes up.</p>

But they've been displaying another shared quality of late: the ability to act clueless about the suddenly snowballing economic boycott of Israeli settlements.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">To be fair, it's a lot more likely that Netanyahu is the one putting on an act. Johansson sincerely appeared to have little idea about what she was getting into when she agreed to be the straw-sipping poster girl of SodaStream, the Israeli maker of home fizzy-drink devices that produces wares in the industrial park of a West Bank settlement. "I never intended on being the face of any social or political movement… or stance," she said in a </span><a href="http://www.upi.com/blog/2014/01/27/Scarlett-Johansson-defends-SodaStream-amid-criticism/2571390831504/" style="line-height: 1.538em;">press statement</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> responding to criticism of her role advertising the firm. This sounds painfully naïve: Nothing having to do with Israeli settlements in occupied territory comes packaged without a political stance, but Johansson may have noticed this only after the ink was dry on the contract. Politics isn't her profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">It is Netanyahu's trade, though. So when he responded to a comment by John Kerry as if the secretary of state had personally threatened Israel with economic sanctions, either Netanyahu knew better or he should have. Kerry, answering a question publicly at the Munich Security Conference last weekend, </span><a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2014/02/221134.htm" style="line-height: 1.538em;">described </a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">potential consequences of a failure of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that he is brokering. "There are [sic] talk of boycotts and other things," Kerry said.  Netanyahu angrily responded in his weekly TV photo-op before the Sunday morning cabinet meeting. "Attempts to impose a boycott on the State of Israel are immoral and unjust," he declared. To make sure the boss's intent was clear, Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz—often a political doppelgänger for Netanyahu—threw in, "Kerry's comments on a boycott … are insulting and intolerable."</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">An analogy may be helpful here. Kerry's remark was a descriptive warning, the equivalent of telling a friend, "I'm worried about you. If you don't stop drinking, you'll lose your job." Netanyahu responded as if the </span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">friend</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> had threatened to get him fired, and answered, "No one's going to tell me what to do." This isn't a way to maintain friendships.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">But as we know, people can get angriest at such warnings when they're true. And in recent weeks, the boycott issue has gone from a peripheral threat to an immediate reality. It has become cause for furious exchanges between cabinet members that foreshadow the collapse of Netanyahu's governing coalition when Kerry finally lays out his framework for a peace agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Here are a few of the eco-sanction headlines that Israelis have been reading: Germany announced that its grants to Israeli high-tech projects will henceforth include a clause barring any funding of projects in occupied territory. A major Dutch firm announced it was backing out of a cooperation deal with the Israeli national water firm Mekorot because the latter pipes waters to settlements. One of the Netherlands' central pension-management funds decided not to invest in Israeli banks that provide financing for building in settlements—which means all major Israeli banks. Norway's government </span><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/53d00268-8a89-11e3-ba54-00144feab7de.html#axzz2sVVlaoHr" style="line-height: 1.538em;">instructed </a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">its sovereign wealth fund, which invests the country's oil revenues, not to touch a major Israeli construction company and its subsidiary because they build in settlements. The Romanian government reportedly nixed a deal to enable Romanians to work in the building trades in Israel, lest they end up on settlement construction sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">These sanctions affect companies and institutions that do business on both sides of the pre-1967 line—but they're all aimed at settlement activity. They're also all European actions. The avalanche began last summer when the European Union laid down guidelines for its own bodies: funds allocated for cooperation with Israel have to be spent </span><em style="line-height: 1.538em;">in Israel,</em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> not in the West Bank, and agreements must say so explicitly. As Israeli officials feared, individual European governments and companies are following the EU lead. Germany joining the trend says it all, given that country's deep, penitence-driven support for a Jewish state. These are Israel's allies, not its enemies. They believe that the settlement habit is driving Israel to ruin. To extend the analogy above, they are like friends telling a heavy drinker, "I'm not lending you subway money unless I know you won't spend it on a bottle."</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The escalating debate within the Israeli government shows that these measures are having an impact, if not setting off a panic. Since the right insists the pre-1967 border is a no more than a historical memory, and a </span><a href="#http://prospect.org/article/mind-eraser-israel-forgets-its-own-border" style="line-height: 1.538em;">vague one</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> at that, it also refuses to acknowledge any distinction between sanctions aimed at settlements and measures aimed against Israel's existence. Steinitz seeks funding for an international media campaign against "delegitimization" of Israel. Economics Minister Naftali Bennett, head of the Jewish Home party, described boycotts as the new face of anti-Semitism, and has also called for a grand new advertising effort in response. Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, who's in charge of negotiations with the Palestinians, answered Bennett on her Facebook with suggestions for truthful slogans, such as, "This isn't South Africa—here the Palestinians aren't second-class citizens, they just aren't citizens at all."</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Imagine, if you will, how Netanyahu would have responded if John Kerry had uttered that sentence. Yet it wasn't the first time that Livni has used the words "South Africa" in warning of the consequences of permanent Israeli rule of the West Bank.  Netanyahu hasn't dismissed her. He only has a majority in parliament by keeping the dedicated advocates of a two-state agreement in his coalition along with the most intransigent opponents. The coalition can survive a Norwegian investment ban. It's hard to see how it will hold together when it has to decide whether to accept an American peace framework calling for a near-total pullback to the pre-1967 lines. Truly, the boycott comment is not the main reason that Kerry makes Netanyahu irritable.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">As for Netanyahu's other, momentary, political partner, Johansson answered criticism of her SodaStream deal with a script written for her by the company: The company's factory in Ma'aleh Adumim provides jobs to Palestinians who receive the same pay as Israelis. This answer is besides the point—not only because Ma'aleh Adumim is on land </span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/29/AR2008092902665.html" style="line-height: 1.538em;">expropriated </a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">in violation of the 1907 Hague Convention on occupation, and not only because Israeli governments subsidized factories in settlements as one more way to make the occupation permanent. It's also because the occupation </span><a href="http://prospect.org/article/wrong-turns" style="line-height: 1.538em;">prevents the growth</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> of an industrialized Palestinian economy that could employ those workers and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">With all due respect, Johansson should have learned more about this before signing the contract. She should care about it. Frankly, Scarlett, you should give a damn.   </span></p>

It's a weird historical anomaly that serves no practical purpose other than allowing the opposition party, should it be sufficiently reckless, to threaten global economic catastrophe if it doesn't get its way. I assumed that your average Washington Democrat would share this view, but now I'm beginning to think that if you're someone like Nancy Pelosi or Barack Obama, the debt ceiling is actually quite helpful, and you'd be sorry to see it go.</p>
<p>Because here's what keeps happening: The debt ceiling approaches. Republicans begin making threats to torpedo the country's economy by not raising it, and thereby sending the United States government into default, if their demands aren't met. We then have a couple of weeks of debate, disagreement, and hand-wringing. Republican infighting grows more intense, and their reputation as a bunch of radicals who are willing to burn down the country to serve their extreme ideology is reinforced. At the end of it, the Republicans cave, the ceiling is raised for some period, and we do it all again in a few months.</p>
<p>And here we go again. The debt ceiling is going to have to be raised in the next month or so. Since the deficit is now <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45010">at its lowest point</a> since Barack Obama took office, it's hard for Republicans to say that slashing the budget is so urgent that it justifies threatening to send America off an economic cliff. So what will they demand as their price for assenting to a debt ceiling increase? The answer is...they can't decide. Yesterday, the House leadership proposed that they demand either a repeal of the "risk corridor" provision in the Affordable Care Act, which protects against a "death spiral" in the individual insurance market (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/27/heres-the-deal-with-the-obamacare-bailout/">here's a good explainer</a> on that), or approval of the Keystone pipeline. As Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/02/house-republican-debt-ceiling-hostage-update.html">pointed out</a>, "Republicans have decided that one of these policy demands is so vital that they can insist its fulfillment justifies the threat of global economic calamity. They're just not sure yet which one." But it turned out that they couldn't even unite around one of those two things, and that proposal of the leadership's is now <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/05/gop-strategy-on-debt-ceiling-stalls/">dead</a>.</p>
<p>So here's where we are. The Republican position is that something or other, let's call it the Policy Change To Be Named Later, is so urgent, so pressing, so essential to the future of this great nation that if they don't get it, whatever it turns out to be, they will force the government into default. And as soon as they figure out what the PCTBNL is, they'll let us know.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Democrats' position is simple: the debt ceiling needs to be raised, without conditions. Period. And that's just what's going to happen. There'll be some hemming and hawing between now and then, but Democrats are going to win this, and Republicans are going to lose, and look like fools. Given that, if you were Barack Obama, wouldn't you be perfectly happy to go through this routine a few more times?</p>
