Provides that a plan of reorganization may establish within a reorganized political subdivision territories or districts: (1) in which specified services provided by the reorganized political subdivision will be provided at different levels, quantities, or amounts; and (2) in which the fees, charges, or taxes imposed by the reorganized political subdivision will vary depending on the level, quantity, or amount of the services.

Provides a property tax exemption for certain property leased to the bureau of motor vehicles or bureau of motor vehicles commission for the 2010 through 2016 assessment dates. Provides that an exemption application does not have to be filed annually to continue the exemption through the 2016 assessment date. Provides that the property tax exemption for fraternity or sorority property applies to property used for administrative purposes, including property owned by a national or international headquarters, fraternity or sorority foundations, and housing corporations.

Revises the language of the written statement that a bidder on property at a tax sale must sign (which concerns the bidder's bid being applied to delinquent taxes owed by the bidder) so as to make that statement consistent with the redemption requirements of the law. Eliminates a provision that applied only to tax sale property that was offered in 2006 and found to be brownfield property.

Establishes a Floyd County park district on January 1, 2012, unless certain action is taken by the fiscal body of the city of New Albany or by the fiscal body of Floyd County. Provides that the park district is not established if before July 1, 2011: (1) a majority of the members elected to the fiscal body of the city of New Albany adopt a resolution providing that the park district shall not be established; or (2) a majority of the members elected to the fiscal body of Floyd County adopt a resolution providing that the park district shall not be established. Provides that the district is a separate municipal corporation, the boundaries of which are coterminous with the boundaries of the county. Provides that the governing body of the district is a nine member park commission. Specifies that a member of the commission may not receive a salary or a per diem. Specifies the membership of the commission. Provides for staggered terms. Provides that (unless the district is not established because of action by the fiscal body of the city of New Albany or by the fiscal body of Floyd County) all parks departments within the county are abolished on January 1, 2012, and all property and obligations of the parks departments in the county are transferred to the district. Provides that indebtedness and pension obligations incurred by a unit before the creation of the district: (1) may not be imposed on taxpayers that were not responsible for payment of the indebtedness or pension obligations before the district was created; and (2) must be paid by the taxpayers that were responsible for payment of the indebtedness or pension obligations before creation of the district. Provides that the park district is subject to certain provisions of the general park and recreation law. Provides that if the commission before January 1, 2022, conveys any real property that was transferred to the district by a park department upon the establishment of the district, the commission shall distribute any proceeds or other remuneration from the conveyance to the county or city from which the property was transferred. Specifies that this restriction does not apply to: (1) the conveyance of real property by the commission back to the county or city from which the property was originally transferred; or (2) the lease of real property, if that real property is leased as of December 31, 2011, for a purpose related to parks and recreation, and after December 31, 2011, the commission enters into or renews a lease of that real property for substantially the same purpose. Provides that all personnel employed by abolished park departments within the county are eligible to transfer to the district. Provides that all personnel that participate in the public employee's retirement fund (PERF) as employees of an abolished park department shall continue to participate in PERF upon becoming employed by the district. Provides that, subject to the property tax levy limits, the district may levy a tax annually on the taxable property in the district for park purposes. Specifies the initial maximum permissible property tax levy for the district for property taxes first due and payable in 2012. Provides that the department of local government finance (DLGF) shall reduce the maximum permissible property tax levy for Floyd County and the maximum permissible property tax levy for the city of New Albany. Specifies that the total combined reduction is equal to the result of $150,000 plus an amount equal to the amount of the park district's maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy determined for property taxes first due and payable in 2012. Requires the DLGF to compute the portion of the reduction to be applied to Floyd County and the portion of the reduction to be applied to the city of New Albany so that a levy reduction would not by itself, after considering the elimination of the existing county property tax levy for park purposes and considering the total amount of property taxes that may be imposed in the county by the district, result in a change in the total tax rate imposed on any taxpayer in Floyd County. Provides that the members of the park district commission shall be appointed before July 1, 2011 (unless the park district shall not be established because of the adoption of a resolution by the fiscal body of the city of New Albany or Floyd County). Provides that the park district commission shall in 2011 adopt the initial budget and tax levy of the park district for 2012. Specifies that during 2011 the commission has no other powers and duties related to parks and recreation. Provides that the commission may purchase a blanket bond or a crime insurance policy to cover the faithful performance of all employees, commission members, and persons acting on behalf of the district." class="bill-link">HB 1507</a></td>
