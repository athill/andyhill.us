			My name is Andy Hill. I am a programmer in <a href="http://bloomington.in.gov/" target="_blank">Bloomington, Indiana</a>. &nbsp;
			Primarily a web developer. I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from &nbsp;
			<a href="https://www.iu.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana University</a> &nbsp;
			at the age of 33. I currently work for the University in <a href="https://uits.iu.edu/" target="_blank"> &nbsp;
			<abbr title="University Information Technology Services">UITS</abbr></a>&apos;s &nbsp;
			<abbr title="Enterprise Service Integration">ESI</abbr> Middleware Team. There is no relationship between Indiana University and this site.

			//// Fix This
			This site was originally a playground for me to play with web programming technologies, though I tend to use other sites for that now. 
			though there is value to the content as well (I especially find the 
			<a href="/news/">News</a> page practical). Many pages will have a "Geek Out" button 
			at the top. Clicking on this will 
			toggle technical information about the technologies used on the page.

		<p>I've been developing this site intermittently since 2003. Here are a few snapshots through the years (note, not everything works on these sites, but you should be to get around)</p>
