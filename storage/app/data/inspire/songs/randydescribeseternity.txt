Randy Describes Eternity
CONTENT
every thousand years
this metal sphere
ten times the size of Jupiter
floats just a few yards past the earth
you climb on your roof
and take a swipe at it
with a single feather
hit it once every thousand years
`til you've worn it down
to the size of a pea
yeah I'd say that's a long time
but it's only half a blink
in the place you're gonna be

where you gonna be
where will you spend eternity
I'm gonna be perfect from now on
I'm gonna be perfect starting now
stop making that sound
stop making that sound
I will say I forgot it
but it was only yesterday
and it's all you had to say
