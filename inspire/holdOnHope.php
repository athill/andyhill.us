<div style="width: 400px;">

Every street is dark<br />
And folding out mysteriously<br />
Where lies the chance we take to be<br />
Always working<br />
Reaching out for a hand that we<br />
Can't see<br />
Everybody's got a hold on hope<br />
It's the last thing that's holding me<br />
<br />
Invitation to the last dance<br />
Then it's time to leave<br />
But that's the price we pay<br />
When we deceive<br />
One another/animal mother<br />
She opens up for free<br />
Everybody's got a hold on hope<br />
It's the last thing that's<br />
Holding me<br />
<br />
Look at the talkbox in mute<br />
Frustration<br />
At the station<br />
There hides the cowboy<br />
His campfire flickering<br />
On the landscape<br />

That nothing grows on<br />
But time still goes on<br />
And through each life of misery<br />
Everybody's got a hold on hope<br />
It's the last thing that's holding me<br />
