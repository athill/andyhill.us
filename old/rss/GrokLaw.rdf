<title>RH's Linux Achieves CAPP/EAL3  Certification on All IBM eServer Systems</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040819120401170</link>
<description>Things have been so busy with motion practice, I missed this press release from IBM and Red Hat from the first day at LinuxWorld, and it's important to have as part of our collection, so we're prepared for the FUD about open source and security.  It's also important for people to know, in government and in business, that this level of security certification is now achievable on GNU/Linux systems.  This quotation from the Department of Defense says it all: &quot;'The Department of Defense commends IBM and Red Hat for their recent Common Criteria evaluation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3,' said Gary Zelanko, Chief, Enterprise Integration Advanced Analysis Laboratory, Department of Defense. 'Meeting the EAL3 security standard gives the U.S. Department of Defense a greater assurance level when using commercial technology to build secure information systems for the federal government. We appreciate the significant effort that IBM and Red Hat have undertaken to comply with this international standard and their ongoing commitment to achieving even higher assurance levels.'&quot; Here is the press release.</description>

<title>IBM Files For Partial Summary Judgment on 8thCounterclaim Copyright Infringement -PDF and text</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040818183723609</link>
<description>Man, this just isn't SCO's week.  IBM has just filed another Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, this one on its 8th Counterclaim, the one for copyright infringement.  No, silly,  not IBM copying SCO. It's where IBM says that SCO has literally copied more than 783,000 lines of code from 16 packages of IBM's copyrighted material.  They are asking for summary judgment as to liability and a permanent injunction.  Here's the lesson. You don't ever want IBM legally mad at you.  SCO and friends keep floating these rumors about SCO settling or being bought up. I think IBM has other plans, like crushing SCO like a bug.    Here is the motion, and there will soon be a memorandum in support, which should be hilarious reading, so stay tuned.   It may take a little time before the document resolves. Meanwhile, Tuxrocks has a link that works.   I always said the GPL was SCO's Achilles Heel,  way back from the very beginning, when I was a tiny little voice in the wilderness, and now I get to watch it play out just as I knew it could and should.  I'm thinking this will be the end of the FUD about the GPL never being tested in court.  That'll be refreshing not to have to hear that any more.    Rest in peace, dead old FUD #1.  Some of your cousins will be joining you soon in the Olde GPL FUD graveyard. UPDATE:  Here is the Redacted Memorandum in Support.  Enjoy.</description>

<title>Linus on Patents, Innovation . . .  and Groklaw</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2004081814191746</link>
<description>BusinessWeek has done an interview with Linus you won't want to miss. He talks about how he structures everything, or watches structure evolve.  It's fascinating, to me especially, because actually I didn't really know how to run Groklaw when  thousands of volunteers suddenly showed up.  There is   no manual when you are the first person to try something, and who do you ask?   I had only the general open source model as a star to guide me.    It's been very much an experiment, so it's nice to learn that his structure is kind of like I see developing here, with certain differences built in due to the different nature of the finished work.  Anyway, it's a very intriguing interview to me, and I think you'll enjoy reading it, maybe from  your own perspective. Linus talks about the open source method for developing software and says when problems get serious enough, you can't have one individual or one company hording all the knowledge, that open source is a better way to do software, and that sharing knowledge results in more stable software.</description>

<title>IBM's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Breach of Contract Claims - PDF and text</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040817180409152</link>
<description>Here is IBM's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Breach of Contract Claims.  This is the motion that yesterday's  memorandum PDF is attached to.  What I enjoy about this Motion is the clarity with which IBM explains SCO's very convoluted claims.  I couldn't have done it, I don't think, in so few words,  so simply yet so comprehensively.  Seriously, try to find a way to say it better than this. I did, and I can't.   Our thanks, once again, to JeR for transcribing.  If you wish to look again at the four causes of action that this motion is addressing, you can go to the SCO Second Amended Complaint PDF, and begin with paragraph 110.  Be aware that there are two paragraphs 110, so look for the second one, right after the heading First Cause of Action.  The document was incorrectly numbered, just one of many little signs that SCO's case had hopped on a slow freighter to nowhere.</description>

<title>Hint to MS: It's Bad When Reporters Burst Into Laughter at Your FUD</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040817033940321</link>
<description>Journalists are a cynical bunch.  They've seen it all, heard execs and politicians spin baloney, and  endured endless press conferences where they've been told what turn out to be lies, so they can be forgiven for ending up Being From Missouri.  The thing about journalists is, they do usually know what is really happening.  They may not print what they know, or all they know, or they may feel compelled to slant it to suit their editors/owners. But they know.So when the announcement was made at a press conference in the UK that Newham, a borough of London, had just decided not to go open source after all and instead to sign on with Microsoft because their software was cheaper than open source and more secure, the room spontaneously burst out laughing. You can maybe buy what journalists print sometimes, but there is no amount of money that can make a cynical heart naive again.   Of course, the entire room knew that was ridiculous.  And, while it is unfortunate that the hustle paid off, it is also encouraging news that this laughter means MS is near the very end of that particular rope. When journalists laugh at your FUD in public, the End is Near.The Register has the very funny story, and more details here.  Here's the part that isn't so amusing. They made their decision to go with Microsoft because of an &quot;independent&quot; study by Capgemini. Guess who paid them to do the study? Yes, boys and girls, future cynics of the world:  The Register reports it was Microsoft.</description>

<title>IBM Goes For the Jugular -- Files Motion For Partial Summary Judgment on Contract Claims</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040816111607708</link>
<description>Here is IBM's Redacted Memorandum in Support of Motion  for Partial Summary Judgment On Breach of Contract Claims, filed by IBM on Friday.  It's a hundred-page PDF.   As you will see, they are going for the jugular now.  Astoundingly, they say that all parties involved in the contract between AT&amp;amp;T and IBM have now provided testimony in discovery that IBM has the right to do whatever it wishes with its own code, contrary to SCO's claims, or as the memorandum puts it, they all provided &quot;unequivocal testimony that the agreements were not intended and should not be understood to preclude IBM's use and disclosure of homegrown code and contemporaneous documents reflect this interpretation of the licenses&quot;.SCO thought it was going to find evidence in discovery to bolster its case, but it has worked out exactly the opposite.   I haven't finished reading the memorandum myself, because I wanted to share it with you immediately, but it looks like this  is the heart of what's left of SCO's case.  Everything you hoped IBM would say to the judge, they are saying, including pointing out that Novell has waived any breach, even if there had been one, which there wasn't. If IBM wins this motion,  I think I might be in my red dress soon.You don't want to miss reading page 76.  It's where IBM tells the judge that as recently as August 4, 2004, SCO was still offering the Linux 2.4 kernel for download,  the very code it is suing IBM over. My understanding of the significance of this revelation is that SCO has now released knowingly all the code at issue under the GPL.  In the beginning of the case, they said they didn't know the allegedly infringing code was in there when they released Linux under the GPL. They can't say that since they filed the lawsuit in March of 2003. Now, in August of 2004, they are still distributing the same code under the GPL.   Under the terms of the GPL, there is no taking that code back that I know of.  I think, therefore, that SCO's case just went poof, on this one issue alone.</description>

<title>Businessweek to  Linux: Dump the GPL So Business Can Embrace and Extend It</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040814064859996</link>
<description>A commentary in Businessweek suggests it would be &quot;good for all concerned&quot; if the icky GPL was done away with. The article, titled &quot;The Big Fly in the Open Source Soup,&quot; ends like this: &quot;Bright as it is, the future of commercial open source might be considerably brighter if Linux and other programs went to a more commerce-friendly license with fewer complexities and ambiguities than the GPL. There's plenty of precedent. The BSD license, the Mozilla Foundation license used for browsers, and the Apache license all provide for free distribution of code and source code with fewer restrictions than the GPL. It will be tremendously controversial in the open-source community, where the GPL sometimes seems more like an object of religious veneration than a legal document, but it would be good for all concerned.&quot; All?  Good for all?  What about  the authors of the code?  They chose the GPL because they wanted to. And they are the copyright holders on the code.   I believe I may speak for the authors of the code when I say that they would just like you to respect their intellectual property, to phrase it in terms you will understand.  Businesses think that if they threaten not to use Linux unless the GPL gets dropped, Linus  will panic and comply. No, he won't.</description>

<title>AutoZone Order - PDF and text</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040815022140934</link>
<description>Here is Judge Robert C. Jones' Order in the AutoZone case.   The judge has clarified some things and  added some  items that were not mentioned at the hearing. It isn't open-ended discovery. It's a really fast track, but the  judge has given SCO a little more time. All discovery must be done by 90 days from the date of the order. Of course, I note the judge changed the date of the order from July to August, when he got around to signing it, so in effect SCO gets more time than if he had signed the order in July, about a month, at least in terms of preparation.  And remember when the judge was asked at the hearing how many depositions would be permitted? He said it was up to the parties to work that out.  Evidently there have been more discussions about that, because he has decided it will be 6 each.  And SCO has only 20 days after the conclusion of the limited discovery to file its motion for a preliminary injunction.  This was not spelled out at the hearing on July 12, and I'm relieved to see it clarified. Also, the periodic reports will have to be not only on IBM and Red Hat cases, as he said at the hearing, but on progress on the Novell case too. You will see some things we haven't seen before in this case, so I will explain. First, the handwritten corrections.  As you may recall from the hearing the judge asked the lawyers for AutoZone to write up the order for his signature. That is what normally happens in such a case. The winning side usually gets &quot;anointed&quot; to do the work.  So they then write up what they think the judge said at the hearing, show it to the other side for approval and then submit it to the judge. He then either signs it or changes whatever he wishes. In this case, he changed some dates. Evidently he decided what he said wasn't enough time for SCO. It also could be that there were telephone conferences with the parties and that resulted in the changes. If you remember, he mentioned he was available for such, as was the magistrate.</description>

<title>Judge Kimball's Order Re Briefing, Shepardizing &amp;amp; Groklaw's Purpose</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040814095900468</link>
<description>Here, as promised, is Judge Kimball's Order Re Briefing for Pending Motions, granting the parties more time to get their motion papers filed.  The court notation listed it as on &quot;IBM Stipulation&quot; and I wondered why. But the order is very clear, that it was on stipulation by both parties.  Just another example that you have to go by the actual court document, not the clerk's notation, or you can get confused. Just an incredible flurry of activity, and no wonder. Both sides realize this could be the ball game, so naturally they are putting their heart into it and trying to get it right. Also, some of the flurry is because of SCO, as IBM pointed out, filing more than once on the same request.</description>

<title>Hearing for Motion to Strike Sontag Declaration Set for 9/14</title>
<link>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040814020045765</link>
<description>IBM's Motion to Strike the Declaration of Christopher Sontag will be heard on September 14, 2004 at 10 AM before Judge Wells.   The previously scheduled hearing on SCO's Motion to Compel, set for September 2, will now be heard the same day as IBM's Motion to Strike, on the 14th.   That is the day before the hearing set for SCO's Amended Motion to Dismiss or Stay Count Ten of IBM's 2nd Amended Counterclaims and IBM's Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for Declaratory Judgment of Non-Infringement. This will be before Judge Kimball. So September will be hopping.</description>
