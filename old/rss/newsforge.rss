<title>Skinny is speedy thanks to OSS</title>
<link>http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=07/03/09/214221&amp;from=rss</link>
<description>SkinnyCorp.com has built a group of community-based sites on a traditional LAMP stack -- Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. SkinnyCorp software engineer Harper Reed credits the open source infrastructure with keeping the business agile. He says the licensing costs of proprietary software would have strangled a business that's growing as quickly as his.</description>

<title>How to hide an entire filesystem</title>
<link>http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=07/03/12/1559247&amp;from=rss</link>
<description>Simple file encryption is useful, but sometimes it's more useful to encrypt a complete filesystem or disk, such as when you need to protect a large set of files. Or you may need not only to protect, but to completely hide the presence of sensitive data from prying eyes. For these cases, here are several options for securing your systems.</description>

<title>A dozen tips for testing free software</title>
<link>http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=07/03/07/2012221&amp;from=rss</link>
<description>One of the best ways you can participate in the free and open source software (FOSS) revolution is by helping to test software and reporting bugs and issues to project developers to help them improve their code. Even in the wild and woolly, sometimes undisciplined approach to development that we see in FOSS projects, there are ways to test more effectively. Here are more than a dozen tips suggested by testing gurus and developers that can help you become a successful tester.</description>

<title>Introduction to OpenID</title>
<link>http://internet.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=07/03/07/1911209&amp;from=rss</link>
<description>OpenID is an open decentralized digital identity system that has been gaining traction in recent months. It implements a solution to some everyday headaches such as single-sign-on, but it does not address related issues like privacy, trust, spam prevention, or message authentication. OpenID uses a multiple-stage sign-on process, but don't let that discourage you. As an end user, the benefits are stacked in your favor.</description>

<description>Once again, the Debian project is gearing up to elect a new project leader, with voting set to begin late this month. As we did last year, we asked the DPL candidates to sound off on some of the issues that will face the Debian Project in the next year.</description>

<description>First, blogs moved from personal platforms to corporate tools. Now, wouldn't it be great to put social networking to work in your organization? Elgg is an open source application for creating social networks. It can be customized with themes and extended with plugins to work with other social networks or plug into an organization's existing wiki and forum boards. It lets users collaborate on projects within organizations or share notes within a university.</description>

<title>Continuous integration with PHP</title>
<link>http://programming.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=07/03/06/2039205&amp;from=rss</link>
<description>Large development projects can be difficult to manage. With multiple developers committing source code to one source tree, there are going to be times when code breaks and will not work. Running automated builds and tests on code can drastically reduce the time and effort developers spend fixing issues by catching them early. This process is called continuous integration. This article provides an overview of how to implement continuous integration in a PHP project using tools written in PHP.</description>

<title>Zabbix: State-of-the-art network monitoring</title>
<link>http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=07/03/06/1615244&amp;from=rss</link>
<description>I have used BigBrother and Nagios for a long time to troubleshoot network problems, and I was happy with them -- until Zabbix came along. Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution for servers, network services, and network devices. It's easier to use and provides more functionality than Nagios or BigBrother.</description>

<description>It seems to be a trend among some proprietary software vendors: attacking open source with lies. The latest appears in this week's Network World's Face-off, which features a slop-bucket full of self-serving hogwash by Ipswitch's Roger Greene entitled "Don't trust your network to open source."</description>

<title>Publishing Writer documents on the Web</title>
<link>http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/22/1727259&amp;from=rss</link>
<description>Although OpenOffice.org has an HTML/XHTML export feature, it is not up to the snuff when it comes to turning Writer documents into clean HTML files. Instead, this feature turns even the simplest Writer documents into HTML gobbledygook, and while it attempts to preserve the original formatting, the results are often far from perfect. Moreover, publishing static HTML pages is so '90s: today, blogs and wikis rule the Web. So what options do you have if you want to convert your Writer documents into tidy HTML pages or wiki-formatted text files? Quite a few, actually.</description>
