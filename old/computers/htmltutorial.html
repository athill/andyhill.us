This tutorial is going to cover the basics of XHTML, HTML is the <u>H</u>yper  
<u>T</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage and XHTML is HTML that conforms to the rules of XML. 
XHTML is used to format 
web pages. It uses tags surrounding text elements to indicate how to 
format the text. For example, to add write a word in <em>italics</em>, 
you would enclose the word in tags like this: 
<br />
&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;<br>  All XHTML markup tags are enclosed in less-than
(&lt;) and greater-than(&gt;) signs. For convenience, these are often 
referred to as 'angle brackets' to differentiate them from parentheses(()), 
square brackets([]), and curly braces({}). Angle brackets were probably 
chosen for this task as they are less common than the other delimiters and 
allow you to use the other delimiters without worrying about it. All angle 
brackets in an HTML document are considered delimiters, so if you actually 
want to display a less-than or greater-than sign, you must use an escape 
sequence(for example, &amp;lt;, for less-than). We'll discuss that more later.
<br /><br />
For now, just remember that all HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets.  
Most HTML tags come in pairs, like the italics tag above. In this case, 
&lt;em&gt; means "start doing italics here" and &lt;/em&gt;(with a '/' following the 
'&lt;') means "stop doing italics here".  Another simple tag that uses this 
formula is:
<ul>
<li>&lt;strong&gt;<strong>bold</strong>&lt;/strong&gt;</li>
</ul>
Tags that don't come in pairs are called "empty tags."  Empty tags must 
close themselves by having a " /" before the closing angle bracket for example a horizontal rule 
(a line across the page) is expressed as:
<ul>
<li>&lt;hr /&gt;</li>
</ul>

and creates:
<hr />

<a name="doc_struc"><h2>Document Structure</h2></a>
In addition to formatting text, tags are also used to format the document 
itself.  Each HTML document starts with &lt;html&gt; and ends with 
&lt;/html&gt;.  Within the document, there is a head and a body, which are 
delimited by &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;, 
respectively. Within the head, is the title, scripts(discussed later), and meta 
tags(also discussed later). The title is the text you would like to appear 
in the browser's title bar(in the case of this page, "Andy's XHTML Tutorial"), 
enclosed in matching &lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt; tags. The body holds the 
substance of the HTML document.  So a skeletal HTML document would appear as 
such: <br /><br />
&lt;html&gt;<br />
&lt;head&gt;<br />
&lt;title&gt;Your title here&lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;/head&gt;<br />
&lt;body&gt;<br />
Substance of HTML document<br />
&lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;
<br /><br />
A couple of worthy notes:
<ul>
<li>XHTML is case sensitive. &lt;em&gt; is not the same as &lt;EM&gt;. You must use lower case for all tags</li>
<li>Tags must be properly nested. For example, if you have &lt;stong&gt; followed by 
    &lt;em&gt; followed by text, you must first close with &lt;/em&gt;, followed 
    by &lt;/strong&gt;. You must close inner tags before outer tags.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="format"><h2>Formatting</h2></a>
<a name="font"><h3>The Font Tag</h3></a>
<strong>The font tag is deprecated in XHTML. It is recommended you use
Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) to achieve the formatting discussed in this section.
However, the <a href="#color">color</a> section is still relevant.</strong>
In addition to italics, underscore, and bold type, HTML lets you decide 
the size and color of the text.  This is done using the font tag. For 
example, &lt;font size="4" color="blue"&gt;...&lt;/font&gt; would create 
<font size="4" color="blue">text that looks like this</font>. Size and 
color are called attributes of the font tag. The font tag can take a color 
attribute, a size attribute, or both.<br /><br />
The size attribute can take a number of forms:
<ul>
<li>size="<i>n</i>" where n is a number between 1 and 7 sets the size of the 
    font to that size.</li>
<li>size="<i>+n</i>" or size=<i>-n</i> increases or decreases the current 
    font size by <i>n</i>.</li>
<li>size="<i>word</i>" where <i>word</i> is big, small, large, or tiny, sets 
    the font appropriately to the word.</li>
</ul>
<a name="color"></a>
The color attribute can take 2 forms:
<ul>
<li>color="<i>word</i>" where <i>word</i> can be black, blue, cyan, gray, 
           green, lime, magenta, maroon, navy, olive, orange, purple, red, 
	   teal, silver, white, or yellow.</li>
<li>color="<i>code</i>" where <i>code</i> is a pound sign(#) followed by 
    the six character hexadecimal equivelent of the desired color.</li>
</ul>
The hexa-what? you may ask. What this means is an encoding of the 
RGB(Red-Green-Blue) value of the color. Hexadecimal differs from 
decimal in that rather than going from 0-9 to 10, hexadecimal goes from 
0-15 and then to 10. To make this less confusing(maybe), after 9, 
hexadecimal numbering actually goes to a-f, where f=15. So counting to 
decimal 16 in hexadecimal goes: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f,10. 16 in 
decimal is equal to 10 in hexadecimal. 
<br /><br /> 
So having a 6 character hexadecimal code for a color allows you to choose 
between 256 values each for the red, green, and blue components of the color, 
the higher the value, the greater intensity of the color. Some examples 
might help:
<ul>
<li>#000000 is black.</li>
<li>#FFFFFF is white.</li>
<li>#FF0000 is red.</li>
<li>#FFFF00 is yellow.</li>
</ul>
Any of these colors could just as easily be called by name, but more 
original colors, such as forest green(#006500) require hexadecimal 
annotation.
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="head"><h3>Headers</h3></a>
HTML also provides 7 levels of headers of the form 
&lt;h<i>n</i>&gt;...&lt;/h<i>n</i>&gt; where <i>n</i> is a number between 1 and 7. 
Headers differ from using the 
font tag with the size attribute in that 
<ul>
<li>The text appears on its own line.</li>
<li>Headers may take an align attribute of left, right, or center.</li>
<li>As opposed to font size, h1 is actually the largest, h7, the smallest.</li>
</ul>
For example, &lt;h3 align="center"&gt;My Header&lt;/h3&gt; displays: 
<h3 align="center">My Header</h3>
The default alignment for headers is left.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<br />
<a name="body"><h3>The Body Tag</h3></a>
You can also format an entire HTML document using the body tag. Its 
attributes include bgcolor to set the background color for the page
and text to set the text color for the page. link, alink, and vlink 
can be used to set the color of links, active links, and visited links 
respectively(links are discussed soon). All these attributes use the 
same color representations as the font <a href="#color">color</a> attribute. So, for example, 
&lt;body bgcolor="#000000" text="#FFFFFF" link="#FFFF00"&gt;...&lt;/body&gt; 
makes the background color of the page black, the default text is white, 
and all links which have not been clicked are yellow.    
<br /><br />
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="space"><h3>Line Breaks and White Space</h3></a>
HTML ignores line breaks and all white space after the first in a sequence. 
By default, HTML simply wraps text according to the width of your browser 
window. If you want to insert a line break, there are two common ways to 
do it:
<ul>
<li>&lt;br /&gt; inserts a simple line break.</li>
<li>&lt;p&gt;(paragraph)&lt;/p&gt; inserts empty lines above and below the text.</li>
</ul>
Note that unlike most XHTML tags, there is no closing tag for the &lt;br /&gt; tag.
<br /><br />
White space is more difficult to manufacture in HTML. The most common way 
to add white space is the escape sequence, &amp;nbsp;(no-break white space).
Other options include using tables and images(discussed later).
<br /><br />
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="link"><h2>Links and Anchors</h2></a>
One of the greatest things about HTML is the ability to jump from page to 
page or within pages by clicking on links. Links are of the form 
&lt;a href="<i>address</i>"&gt;<i>text to click on</i>&lt;/a&gt; where 
<i>address</i> can be a relative or absolute url(Uniform Resource Locator).
<br /><br /> 
Relative urls are urls that are contained on your site. So for example, 
if I wanted to link to a page in the same directory as the one you're 
currently reading called page2.html, I could just write 
&lt;a href="page2.html"&gt;page2&lt;/a&gt;.  If the file is the directory 
above the page this one, the convention '../' means move up one directory
(i.e., if page2.html is in the directory above the page you're currently 
reading, you could link to it as such: 
&lt;a href="../page2.html"&gt;page2&lt;/a&gt;). If the document is below the 
current document, say in a folder called folder2, You would link to it 
as &lt;a href="folder2/page2.html"&gt;page2&lt;/a&gt; 
<br /><br />
Absolute urls are links to pages not on your site. For these you need the 
full address of the intended page, starting with 'http://'. For example, to 
link to the <a href="http://www.iub.edu">Indiana University Bloomington 
Homepage</a>, you would type 
&lt;a href="http://www.indiana.edu"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;. Similar rules 
apply as to relative links for going inside folders, but you usually 
cannot go up(../), as in relative urls.
<br />
You may also use the target attribute to decide which window the link will 
open in. target="_blank" opens in a new window, _parent, _self, and _top are 
also used, but more often in <a href='#frame'>framesets</a>.  
<br /><br />
Anchors are links within a page. A location on a page can be marked 
usng the syntax &lt;a name=<i>name</i>&gt;<i>name</i>&lt;/a&gt; This 
location can be linked to using the syntax 
&lt;a href="#<i>name</i>"&gt;<i>name</i>&lt;/a&gt;.  If <i>name</i> is 
on another page, say page2.html, use the syntax 
&lt;a href="page2.html#<i>name</i>"&gt;<i>name</i>&lt;/a&gt;.
<br />
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="image"><h2>Images</h2></a>
Linking to images is another important part of HTML. The syntax is simply, 
&lt;img src="<i>image-file</i>" /&gt;.  You can also use an align attribute, the 
options being left, right, and center(default is left).  In addition, it is 
recommended to use height and width attributes. These are given in pixels and 
can indicate the actual dimensions of the image or can be used to shrink or 
expand the image.
<br /><br />
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="list"><h2>Lists</h2></a>
Lists can be ordered or unordered. To begin an unordered list, use &lt;ul&gt;. Beginning 
an ordered list begins with a &lt;ol&gt; tag. Either type of list needs a complementary 
closing tag. Either type of list may take a type attribute to indicate the symbol to 
be used.  

<ul>
<li>Unordered lists may take disc, circle, or square types. This is also the default 
    sequence of symbols for nested ordered lists.</li>
<li>Ordered lists can take type A, a, I, i, or 1, which indicate the starting value 
    of the list. The default is 1.</li>
</ul>

Each item in the list is started with an &lt;li&gt; tag, which does not 
need to be closedi for most browsers, but does to be XHTML compliant. 
<br />
A list of definitions can also be created between &lt;dl&gt;...&lt;/dl&gt; tags.  
In this case, &lt;dt&gt; is used for the term to be defined, and &lt;dd&gt; for the 
definition itself.  Neither of these tags needs to be closed.
<br /><br />
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="table"><h2>Tables</h2></a>
Tables are a powerful way to control the layout of XHTML pages. The basic 
layout is:<p>
<pre>
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  ...
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
<br /><br />
where tr is a table row and td is a table column.  A table can have any 
number of rows and columns, but the number of rows columns must be 
consistent throughout the table. 
<table>
<tr>
<td width="30%">
The table 
<pre>
&lt;table border&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
	One
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
	Two
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
	Three
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
	Four
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
</td>
<td width="30%">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="30%"> 
shows up as
<table border><tr><td>one</td>
<td>two</td></tr><tr><td>three</td><td>four</td></tr></table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

This obstacle can be avoided by using colspan the rowspan attributes 
of the td tag.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="30%">
The table 
<pre>
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
	One
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
	Two
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;
	Three
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
</td>
<td width="30%">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="30%"> 
shows up as
<table border="1"><tr><td>one</td>
<td>two</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">three</td></tr></table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The table tag can take several attributes.  Border=<i>n</i> creates a border of <i>n</i> pixels. 
Border color can be set for 
the entire border as bordercolor=<em>color</em> where <a href="#color">color</a> can be the same values used in the 
font tag. You can also use the align attribute with the values 
left, right, or center.  The width of the table can also be set.  cellspacing(space 
between cells) and  cellpadding(space around the contents of cells) can be indicated in 
pixels.  Finally, you can choose which sides of the frame to display using the frame 
attribute which can take the following values: void(no borders), above, below, hsides, 
vsides, rhs, lhs, or box(default) and rules, for determining which inner borders to 
show. Possible values are none, rows, cols, and all(default).
<br /><br />
The td tag also has several attributes. These include height, width, align and valign(for the 
cell's contents), bgcolor, and background(which takes an image).
<br /><br />
Tables can also be nested.
<br /><br />
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="frame"><h3>Frames</h3></a>
Frames allow you to have more than one page on your screen at a time. This 
can be useful if you want to have a static menu that navigates the rest 
of the page. The frame declaration goes between the closing head and 
opening body tags. A frameset starts with a &lt;frameset&gt; tag, which 
takes either a rows or cols attribute, depending on whether you want 
your frames to appear as rows or columns. The value of the rows or cols 
attibute is a quoted list containing either the length or width in pixels 
of each frame or the percentage of screen width or height for the frame to 
occupy. One of the elements in the quoted list can be an asterisk(*), 
which indicates that that frame take up any space not occupied by the 
other frames. 
Following the opening frameset tag are a series of frame tags, one for each 
element in the list in the frame tag. Frame tags have two attributes, 
a name field used to identify the frame and an src field which indicates 
the url of the frame. Finally, a &lt;/frameset&gt; tag closes the 
frameset. 
<br /><br />
For example:<br />
&lt;frameset cols="100, *"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;frame name="menu" src="menu.html" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;frame name="content" 
src="http://www.mypage.com/pageone.html /"&gt;<br />
&lt;/frameset&gt;
<br /><br />
Creates a page with a 100 pixel wide menu and content filling the rest of 
the screen. Cols go left to right, rows go top to bottom. In order 
to make the links on the menu change the content in the comment frame, 
use the target attibute of the a href tag(i.e., 
&lt;a href="http://www.mypage.com/page2" target="content"&gt;). To jump 
out of a frameset, use the predefined "_top" value for target. You can also set 
target to _self, to open in the current frame, or _parent in a nested frameset.  
If you're worried about browsers that don't support frames(which are increasingly 
rare), you may supply alternate content in the body between 
&lt;noframes&gt; and &lt;/noframes&gt; tags. Framesets can also be nested 
to allow both rows and columns of frames.

The frameset tag has a couple other attributes, namely, bordercolor, which 
takes either predefined colors or hexadecimal color definitions and border, 
which indicates the width, in pixels, of the borders between frames(5 is 
default, 0 removes borders completely).    
  
The frame tag also has other attributes. Each frame has a border of 8 pixels 
on each side. This default can be changed using the marginwidth and 
marginheight attributes. Whether a user can scroll on a frame is usually 
decided by the frame's content compared to the size of the frame. However, 
this can be altered using the scrolling attribute, which can take a yes or 
no value.  Finally, adding the attribute "noresize"(with no value) can 
prevent users from resizing frames, which they could normally do.
<br /><br />
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<a name="form"><h3>Forms</h3></a>
Forms are used to transfer user data. Forms generally have an action attribute
that indicates a script(such as Perl, PHP, ASP, or JSP) that will process the 
form.  If you're just starting with forms and don't know any scripting language, 
you can also use action="mailto:your@email.address" to send the submitted data
to your email account. Forms are enclosed in corresponding &lt;form&gt; tags 
and can include the following, in addition to other valid HTML elements: 

<ul>
  <li>Input elements. These are standalone attributes that require a 
      parameter called type. The type can be text for standard text; 
      password, for text that shows up as asterisks on the user's screen;
      and file, which adds a 'browse' button, which users may click 
      to find a file, or they may specify the path to a file in the 
      text box. Either way, the file is uploaded to the server.  Other 
      attributes include 'name', which specifies the name the value is 
      associated with, and value, for specifying a default value.
      for example:<br />
      <pre>
      &lt;form action='myscript.cgi'&gt;<br />
        Name:&lt;input type='text' name='fun' value='wheee!' /&gt;&ltbr /&gt;<br />
        Password:&lt;input type='password' name='secret' /&gt;&ltbr /&gt;<br />
        File:&lt;input type='file' name='myfile' /&gt;<br />
      &lt;/form&gt;
      </pre>
      <br />
      Would produce:
      <form>
      Name:<input type='text' /><br />
      Password:<input type='password' /><br />
      File:<input type='file' />
      </form>
      The text in the Name textbox would be associated with the name fun, 
      Password with secret, and File with file.
   </li>
   <li>Textarea. This element has opening a closing tags, where text 
       between the tags is the default text in the text area. Attributes 
       of the textarea tag include name, which serves the same function 
       as in the input tag and cols and rows, to specify the number of 
       columns and rows in characters in the textarea, respectively.
       For example:<br />
      <pre>
      &lt;form action='myscript.cgi'&gt;<br />
        &lt;textarea name='mytext' rows='5' cols='10'&gt;Default text&lt;/textarea&gt;<br/>
      &lt;/form&gt;<br />
      Would produce:
      <form>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='10'>Default text</textarea>
      </form>      
      and send either the default text or anything you appended or replaced it 
      with associated with the name mytext to the script myscript.cgi.
    </li>
   <li>Select. The select element is used to compose dropdown boxes. The select 
       element contains a name attribute, like the input element. Select has 
       opening and closing tags in between which are any number of paired 
       option tags.  Each option tag represents a member of the dropdown 
       list. The option tags have an attribute value, which specifies the 
       value that will be sent to the server if this option is selected. 
       one of the option tags may also include the 'selected' keyword if you 
       want one value to come up by default.
       For example:
      <pre>
      &lt;form action='myscript.cgi'&gt;<br />
        &lt;select name='dropdown'&gt;<br />
          &lt;option value='first'&gt;first&lt;/option&gt;<br />
          &lt;option value='second'&gt;second&lt;/option&gt;<br />
         &lt;option value='third' selected&gt;third&lt;/option&gt;<br />
        &lt;/select&gt;<br />
      &lt;form&gt;
      </pre>
      <br />
      Would produce:
      <form>
      <select>
      <option>first</option>
      <option>second</option>
      <option selected>third</option>
      </select>
      </form>
      Sending the selected option with the name 'dropdown' to myscript.cgi..
    </li>
    <li>More input types. 2 other types of input elements are checkbox and radio. 
        These differ in that you always want to include a value attribute 
        and the name attribute is used to group elements together. These are 
        also paired tags. You may also use th selected keyword for one 
        radio type and any number or checkbox types.<br />
        <pre>
        &lt;form action='myscript.cgi&gt;
          &lt;input type='radio' name='myradio' value=first /&gt;first&lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;input type='radio' name='myradio' value=second /&gt;second&lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;input type='radio' name='myradio' value=third /&gt;third&lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;input type='checkbox' name='mycheck' value=first /&gt;first&lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;input type='checkbox' name='mycheck' value=second /&gt;second&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;input type='checkbox' name='mycheck' value=third /&gt;third&lt;br /&gt;
        </pre>
        would create:
        <form action='myscript.cgi'>
        <input type='radio'>first</input>
        <input type='radio'>second</input>
        <input type='radio'>third</input><br />
        <input type='checkbox'>first</input>
        <input type='checkbox'>second</input>
        <input type='checkbox'>third</input>
        </form>
        and send the selected radio button value as my radio and any selected 
        checkboxes as mycheck to myscript.cgi.
    </li>
    <li>Still more input types. There are 2 more input types: submit and clear.
        These are also standalone elements, where submit sends the form to the 
        location specified in the form action attribute and clear clears all 
        data that is filled in. The value attribute specifies the text 
        that will appear on the button created.  For example, <br />
        &lt;form action="../cgi-bin/myscript.cgi" target="newWindow"&gt;<br />
        &lt;input type='text' name='mytext' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />
        &lt;input type='submit' value='Submit' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />
        &lt;input type='reset' value='Clear' /&gt;<br />
        &lt;/form&gt;<br />
        Would create:
        <form action="../cgi-bin/myscript.cgi" target="newWindow">
        <input type='text' name='mytext'><br />
        <input type='submit' value='Submit'>
        <input type='reset' value='Clear'>
        </form>
 

       
</ul>
