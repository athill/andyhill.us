	"http://digital.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=2542">
	A Doll's House</a></u> by Henrik Ibsen, as an acquaintence of mine 
	is going to be in it.  
	Very interesting. Makes you think about devotion and happiness.  Also 
	watched <u>xXx</u>. If you want depth, watch something
	else, but if you want lots of action, explosions, and cool effects, 
	watch this.</td>

	<td width="85%">Finished <u><a href=
	"http://www.foxmovies.com/fightclub/">Fight Club</a></u>. 
	Interesting book. It 
	really addresses the unibomber in all of us. Personally, I'm over 
	that whole proposed solution to our global conundrum, but it 
	was well put together. And I appreciate the 'going for the jugular'
	approach to life it supports. The movie followed it pretty closely, 
	but the ending's different. Also checked out the movie, <u>
	Breakfast at Tiffanie's</u>. Good movie. Henri Mancini did a great 
	job with the soundtrack("Moon River"). Kind of reminds me of some 
	girls I've known. God bless them.</td>

	<td width="85%">Reading <u>Trainspotting</u> by Irvine Welsh.
	Really good. Especially if you have an addictive personality.  
	Also picked up <u>Fight Club</u>, which also looks like a good read.  
	Went to "Shakespeare in the Park" a free series in 3rd Street  
	park and saw "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Rather than the usual 
	conservative interpretation, this production turned the play 
	into a musical based on 80's celebrities. I think I would have 
	preferred the traditional, but it was cute and clever.</td>
