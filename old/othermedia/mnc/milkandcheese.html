		 	polite person's vice. They do what nice people don't and show no
			remorse.They join the War on Drugs, not to help people, but to stop
			the anti-drug commercials interrupting their favorite t.v. shows. 				Their final solution to the drug problem is to burn the city 					down("Fire -- the Biblical cleanser")<p>A more serious side 					occasionally rears its head, however, such as the strip addressing 				the Rodney King beating and one taking on animal testing. Despite 				the rampant violence and insolence, Mr. Dorkin appears to have a 					conscience, but he doesn't let it get in the way of Milk and 					Cheese's fun. With such slogans as "Onward to mayhem!" and  </td>
		<td colspan=1  width="259" rowspan=1 valign=top border="0"><font size=4>				<p>"Let things get out of hand!" M&C take no prisoners in their war 				against unfunniness and general lameness.I suppose I  						should also note that what sets M&C apart from your average violence 				is the clever style, constantly playing with the comic medium and 				the readers expectations. In one panel, they're terrorizing old 					ladies, in the next, they have halos and Little Orphan Annie 					eyes(and in another, they may have halos <u>while</u> terorizing old 				ladies.)
			<P>So enough of my ranting about how great Milk and Cheese are. Now 				it's your turn to get off your lazy butt(actually all you have to do 				is point and click) and buy their stuff at
			<a href=http://www.slavelabor.com>slavelabor.com</a> Go on! Do
			it! You're not getting any funnier by not reading it, and although 				you probably are terminally unfunny, you'll never know if you don't 				read Milk and Cheese. Okay, fine, enough of the pleading, M&C say 				"Ick!", "Poo!" and "Feh!", and spit on you. HUZZAH!!! </td>

When they're not rioting or burning down 					orphanages, they watch tv and drink massive amounts of alcohol. Even 				though I don't watch t.v., I still find them very funny. The above 				is taken from <u>Fun With Milk & Cheese</u>, which includes crashing 				a wine tasting, demolishing hippies, destroying a comic book 					convention, and a game of truth or dare where the dares include 					drinking 50 beers(that's breakfast) and punching God in the 					kidney.</td>
