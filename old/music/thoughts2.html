<a name='air'><b>Air</b></a>
<br>
Air's album, <u>10000 Hz Legend</u> absolutely blows my mind.  They have a way of mixing futuristic detatchment and soul that is quite fresh to my veteran ears.  Beck is on a couple tracks, doing some of his best work ever on <a href='tunes/vagabond.wav'> 'Vagabond'</a> and Buffalo Daughter(formerly of the Beastie Boys' Grand Royale Records) contribute vocals on 'Sex Born Poison.' Other tight tracks include 'People in the City', 'Don't be light', and the rest of the album.  They also did the soundtrack for <u>The Virgin Suicides</u>, I haven't heard it, but I bet it's good. Online, check out <a href='http://www.caroline.com/associated/source/air/' onMouseOver='window.status='Breathe';return true;'onMouseOut='window.status='';return true;'>Air - The Source</a> and the <a href='http://www.10000hzlegend.com' onMouseOver='window.status='10000hzlegend.com';return true;'onMouseOut='window.status='';return true;'> album web page.</a><p>
<a name='beatles'><b>The Beatles</b></a>
<br>
Have you heard of these guys? No, seriously, I think there's a reason these guys are so long-lived and popular. The Lennon-McCartney duality with George and Ringo filling it out. Also, just considering their trek from sugar-sweet 'Love Me Do' to ,oh, 'A Day in the Life', and it's all good. Big-time innovators.<p>
<a name='blondie'><b>Blondie</b></a>
<br>
From Funk to Disco, Blondie blazed trails with their fresh sound. Ranging from the disco smash 'Heart of Glass' to the Carribean-feel 'Tide Is High', to one of the first rap-cross-overs, 'Rapture', Blondie never let their success interfere with their innovation.<p>
<a name='bowie'><b>David Bowie</b></a>
<br>
David Bowie is deservedly a rock legend. Just listen to <u>ChangesOneBowie</u> for undeniable proof some of his albums are a bit patchy, but <u>Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars</u> is immaculate and <u>Hunky Dory</u> is amazing as well.  A must for any collection. <p>
<a name='built'><b>Built to Spill</b></a>
<br>
I love these guys! Musically complex and kinda symmetrical sounding with thoughtful lyrics. I'd highly recommend <u>Perfect From Now On</u>, <u>Keep It Like a Secret</u>, and <u>Ancient Melodies of the Future</u>.<p>
<a name='cave'><b>Nick Cave</b></a>
<br>
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are a truly amazing group. Evolving gracefully from the mayhem of the Birthday Party to the intensity of <u>Let Love In</u> and 'The Mercy Seat', their sound and lyrics have become more introspective over time, so that you're more likely to cry than riot.  'People Ain't No Good' is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard.<p>
<a name='costello'><b>Elvis Costello</b></a>
<br>
Elvis Costello is definitely one of the most talented songwriters and performers in recent times. His early stuff with the Attractions laid the groundwork for all future power-pop. From the thumping bass of 'Pump It Up' to the roaring guitar of 'What's So Funny About(Peace, LOve, and Understanding)' to the interpolating tempo of 'Accidents Will Happen,' Elvis and co. had tight songs and tight performances that I never grow tired of.<p>
<a name='dido'><b>Dido</b></a>
<br>
I don't know that much of Dido's stuff. She's in some band with her brother. I really like her solo album ,<u>No Angel</u>, though. It rocks.<p>
<a name='faith'><b>Faith No More</b></a>
<br>
I don't know that much of Dido's stuff. She's in some band with her brother. I really like her solo album ,<u>No Angel</u>, though. It rocks.<p>
<a name='janes'><b>Jane's Addiction</b></a>
<br>
Jane's Addiction rocks! In the early nineties, they revolutionized rock with hard hitting social commentary such as 'Idiots Rule' and 'Jane Says'. They're now back with a new album, Strays, which shows their staying power.<p>
<a name='loveand'><b>Love and Rockets</b></a>
<br>
If you've never heard Love and Rockits, it's three of the former members of Bauhaus doing heavily synthesized new wave psychedelia with lyrics influenced by Eastern philosophy.  Check out <a href='tunes/dogend.wav'>'Dog-End of a Day Gone By'</a> from <u>Seventh Dream of a Teenage Heaven</u>. It's probably my favorite album of theirs, the other classics are <u>Express</u>, <u>Earth Sun Moon</u>(featuring 'No New Tale to Tell'), and their eponymous album.<p>
<a name='madonna'><b>Madonna</b></a>
<br>
Madonna is a force to be reckoned with. After 20 years of solid hit-making, this is hard to dispute. She's always been an innovator. So get into the groove. 'And you can dance(for inspiration).'<p>
<a name='mclachlan'><b>Sarah McLachlan</b></a>
<br>
Sarah's music is beautiful and inspiring. She has an amazing sense for the subtler facets of life. Her voice is also powerful and amazing. Check out <u>Fumbling Toward Ecstasy</u>, <u>Surfacing</u>, and <u>Mirrorball</u>.<p>
<a name='nodoubt'><b>No Doubt</b></a>
<br>
No Doubt is a great band, ranging from ska, to rock, to folksie sound, to dance, to whatever. Not to mention Gwen Stefani is a total hottie. I've liked all I've heard, which is primarily <u>Tragic Kingdom</u> and <u>Rock Steady</u>, and I'd love to get more.<p>
<a name='outkast'><b>Outkast</b></a>
<br>
Outkast is one of the greatest rap groups ever. They've been putting out good, original stuff for years, but their latest, <u>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</u>, a split double album, ahlf by Big Boi and half by Andre 3000, might be their best yet. <p>
<a name='parliament'><b>P-Funk</b></a>
<br>
One nation under a groove. I realize that James Brown may have started funk, but Funkadelic created an entire cosmology. They also created some of the most dancable music ever. From 'Up For the Down Stroke' to 'Chocolate City' to the harsh realities of 'Cosmic Slop', Funkadelic urges listeners to free their minds, such that their a**es might follow. Can you get to that?<p>
<a name='phair'><b>Liz Phair</b></a>
<br>
Liz rocks! Not only a great singer and songwriter, but a great guitarist too(and she's sexy). I would check out <u>Exile in Guyville</u>, <u>Whipsmart</u> and <u>Whitechocolatespaceegg</u>.<p>
<a name='radiohead'><b>Radiohead</b></a>
<br>
Radiohead is an absolutely brilliant band who create sonic soundscapes charged with emotion. Some of my favorite songs are 'Fake Plastic Trees', 'The Bends', 'Karma Police', and <a href='tunes/idioteque.wav' onMouseOver='window.status='Ice age comin\'';return true;'onMouseOut='window.status='';return true;'> 'Idioteque.'</a>  You should pick up <u>The Bends</u>, <u>O.K. Computer</u>, <u>Kid A</u>, and <u>Amnesiac</u>.<p>
<a name='ramones'><b>The Ramones</b></a>
<br>
Gabba-Gabba-Hey! The Ramones did the brilliant thing of taking 50's melodies, speeding them the heck up, and adding funny lyrics. Classics include, 'Teenage Lobotomy', 'I Wanna Be Sedated', and 'Psychotherapy.' This is not to discount their more thoughtful side, which comes out on such tunes as 'Bonzo Goes to Bizberg' and their classic cover of 'Needles and Pins.' Their earlier albums are probably the best and <u>Ramones' Mania</u> is a must for the  uninitiated.<p>
<a name='reed'><b>Lou Reed</b></a>
<br>
Lou Reed is a pillar of rock and roll. He started with the Velvet Underground, a band that challenged the musical landscape in the '60's with a combination of noise, dischord, nice pop songs, and ultimate coolness. From there he launched a solo career, where he dabbled in glam, challenged musical boundaries, and wrote more great pop songs. He's best known for such songs as 'Sweet Jane', 'Rock and Roll', and 'Walk on the Wild Side', but I would recommendthe entire Velvet Undrground collection, and his <u>Transformer</u>,  <u>Street Hassle</u>, <u>New York</u> and probably more I haven't heard. Lou just knows how to keep it simple and Rock.<p>
<a name='rem'><b>R.E.M.</b></a>
<br>
Whether they are Rapid Eye Movements or Remedial English Majors, R.E.M. is one of the greatest bands of our era. I haven't really kept up with them, but their albums <u>Chronic Town</u> through<u>Out of Time</u> are all classics. My favorites are probably <u>Murmur</u> and <u>Lifes Rich Pageant</u>. And, sue me, but I think 'Everybody Hurts' is a great song.  They combine great pop sensibility with a little Southern twist and intelligent lyrics(when you can understand them).<p>
<a name='rolling'><b>The Stones</b></a>
<br>
Ya gotta give it up for the Stones. If for no reason than longevity, but that does them a disservice in terms of their style and innovation. They got blues, country and rock and roll down and they got the sass the Beatles missed. Yeah, 'Sympathy for the Devil' kind of creeps me out too, but check out 'Shine a Light', from <u>Exile On Main Street</u>.<p>
<a name='smashing'><b>Smashing Pumpkins</b></a>
<br>
The Smashing Pumkins is a very good band. I remember when <u>Siamese Dream </u> was first out and it just seemed to sum up the feeling of the whole scene and no other album takes me back to that time like that one. <u>MellonCollie and the Infinite Sadness</u> is a double album full of great songs such as 'Zero' and 'Butterfly with a Bumblebee Mouth.' I'm sure their other stuff is good too but that's all I've heard.<p>
<a name='tupac'><b>2Pac</b></a>
<br>
You can say what you want about 2Pac but he certainly had moments that I still consider some very lucid rapping. Before you dismiss him as just another 'gunz-n-b******' rapper listen to 'Happy Home' or 'Letter to My Unborn Child' from <u>Until the End of Time</u> or 'Young N*****z' from <u>Me Against the World</u>. The man was prolific profound and brilliant.<p>
<a name='urgeover'><b>Urge Overkill</b></a>
<br>
UO is an Arena-rock tour-de-force with catchy hooks obscure pop-culture lyrics and a sound that's out of this world. My favorite album of theirs is called <u>Saturation</u> featuring such classics as 'Sister Havana' 'Dropout' and 'Heaven 90210.' Other good albums are <u>The Supersonic Storybook</u> <u>The Stull e.p.</u> <u>Exit the Dragon</u> and Nash Kato's solo album <u>Debutante</u><p>
<a name='williams'><b>Lucinda Williams</b></a>
<br>
Lucinda\'s an amazingly strong woman who puts her all into her songs. Her latest album, <u>Essence</u> is so entrenched with feeling it can almost be hard to listen to even though it\'s great. <u>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</u> deservedly won a Grammy and <u>Lucinda Williams</u>is excellent too. I also saw her at Mars nightclub here in Bloomington and can testify that her live performance is amazing.<p>
