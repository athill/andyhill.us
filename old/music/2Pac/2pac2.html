<b>The Rose that Grew from the Concrete</b>
<br><br>
	Did you hear about the rose that grew<br>
	From a crack in the concrete?<br>
	Proving nature's law wrong<br>
	It learned to walk without having feet.<br>
	Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams<br>
	It learned to breathe fresh air<br>
	Long live the rose that grew from the concrete<br>
	When no one else cared.<br><br>
<b>Only God Can Judge Me</b><br>
(abridged)<br> <br>
	Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back<br>
	I coudn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats<br>
	Will I succeed, paranoid from the weed<br>
	And hocus pocus, tryin' to focus, but I can't see.<br>
	And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time<br>
	Look to the futeure cause the past is all behind me<br>
	Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?<br>
	Everybody dyin', tell me what's the use in tryin'<br>
	I been trapped since birth, cautious 'cause I'm cursed<br>
	And fantasies of my family in a hearse<br>
	And they say it's the white man I should fear<br>
	But it's my own Kind doin' all the killin' here<br>
	I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side<br>
	Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died<br>
	Oh my lord, tell me what I'm livin' for<br>
	Everybody's drunk and got me knockin' on heaven's door<br>
	And in my memories, I'm seeing brothers bleed<br>
	And everybody sees, but still noone agrees<br>
	Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix<br>
	'Cause the media is full of dirty tricks<br>
	<i>Only God Can Judge Me</i><br>
	I hear the doctor standing over me screamin' I can make it<br>
	Got a body full of bullet holes layin' here naked<br>
	Still I can't breathe, something evil in my I.V.<br>
	And every time I breathe, I think they killin' me<br>
	I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies<br>
	I wake up stranglin', danglin' my bed sheets<br>
	I call a nurse cause it hurts to reminisce<br>
	How did it come to this, I wish they didn't miss<br>
	Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here<br>
	'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?<br>
	Tryin' to remember, but it hurts<br>
	I'm walkin' through the cemetary talkin' to the dirt<br>
	I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward<br>
	There's a ghetto up in heaven and it's ours, black power,<br>
	Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state<br>
	And our fate is a lifetime of hate<br>
	Dear Mama can you save me?<br>
	And f*** peace, 'cause the streets got our babies<br>
	No more hesitation, each and every black males trapped<br>
	And they wonder why we suicidal, runnin' round strapped<br>
	Mr. Police, <i>please</I> try to see<br>
	That it's a million motherf***ers stressin'(dressin'?) just like me<br>
	<i>Only God Can Judge Me</i><p>
<b>Jada</b><br><br>
	U r the omega of my heart<br>
	The foundation of my conception of love<br>
	When I think of what a black woman should be<br>
	It's u I first think of<br>
	U will never fully understand<br>
	How deeply my heart feels 4 u<br>
	I worry we'll grow apart<br>
	And I'll end up losing u<br>
	U bring me to climax without sex<br>
	And u do it all with regal grace<br>
	u r my heart in human form<br>
	a friend I could never replace.
