	<p>Tupac Amaru Shakur has had a big influence on my life. To me his basic

	message was to live your life to the fullest. In his own words, "If your
		
	gonna do it, do it." And he lived his life that way, recording masses of
		
	material and performing in several movies in just seven years in the
		
	limelight. When he got shot(the first time(or, should I say, the first
		
	<B> five</B> times) and then went immediately to 
jail, he came back even 
	stronger. Due to his bravado, many didn't take
 2Pac as the deeply introspective 
	individual he was. This poem may shed
 light on his true feelings.<br>

Tupac was raised by a strong single mother, who was determined not to let
		
him fall through the cracks of the ghetto. This is probably what led him
		
to write an array of pro-women songs, including "Brenda's Got a Baby",
		
"Keep Ya Head Up", "Dear Mama", and "Baby, Please Don't Cry(Keep Ya Head
		
Up, part 2)." You may know that he was tried for rape, and though I
		
realize it's hard to say, considering his harsh upbringing, I don't
		
believe that his is the poetry of a rapist. In a genre known for
		
women-bashing, I thought it was very strong of him to record adamantly
		
pro-women songs.

		

<p>He also had a lot to say about God, recording such songs as "Only God
		
Can Judge Me", "Lord Knows", and "I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto." To
		
paraphrase from an interview, he was not fond of organized religion, but
		
firmly believed in his own conception of God. He said that "good" is
		
closer to "God" and "evil" is closer to the "devil" and anything you do,
		
good or bad, will come back to you.   As for a reason for
		
others to believe, he said, "We may not walk on the water, but we walk
		
through the 'hood every day without getting shot."

the
 concrete.</font></p>

		

<p align=center><font color=gray size=5>Rest in Peace, Tupac.
