<h1>The Serenity Prayer</h1>

<p>
God grant me the serenity<br />
to accept the things I cannot change;<br />
courage to change the things I can;<br />
and wisdom to know the difference.
</p>

<p>
Living one day at a time;<br />
Enjoying one moment at a time;<br />
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;<br />
Taking, as He did, this sinful world<br />
as it is, not as I would have it;<br />
Trusting that He will make all things right<br />
if I surrender to His Will;<br />
That I may be reasonably happy in this life<br />
and supremely happy with Him<br />
Forever in the next.<br />
Amen.
</p>
