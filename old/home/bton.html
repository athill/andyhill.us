So since I've been in <a href="http://www.bloomington.in.gov/">
Bloomington</a> for the past 12 or so years, I guess I must like it here.  
Coming down fresh out of high school from Indianapolis, Bloomington seemed 
like paradise.  Home to Indiana University, Bloomington offers the cultural 
enrichment and nightlife of a University combined with the closeness of a 
small town.  I've gone without a car for years on end without feeling 
any great inconvenience.  Most residents say what they like about 
Bloomington is the fact that there is enough going on here to have a reasonable nightlife, but still small enough that you know people almost every time you walk 
downtown.  Another attraction is the proximity of 
<a href="http://dcwi.com/~eric/goot/yellowsf.htm">Yellowwood</a> National 
Forest, only about 20 minutes from downtown.

<a name="Food and Fun" id="Food and Fun"><h2>Food and Fun</h2></a>

If you ask me, the best place to go to eat is the 
<a href="upweb/">Uptown Cafe</a>, but I would also recommend Lennie's, the 
Laughing Planet, The Trojan Horse, Brave New Deli, Bear's Place, and 
investigating the wide array of ethnic restaurants in the Kirkwood area.  
For coffee, I usually go to Soma and sometimes the Runciple Spoon.  To see 
music(check out my <a href="../music/btonmusic.html">Local Music Page</a>). 
I usually go to 
<a href="http://secondstorynightclub.com/">2nd Story</a> unless there's a good 
band at the <a href=" http://www.thebluebird.ws">Bluebird</a>. 
Other places for music include Bear's Place(which 
features Jazz Fables, a weekly Jazz show put on every Thursday), 
<a href="http://www.bloomington.in.us/~rhinos/">Rhino's</a> 
all-ages, Vertigo, Space 101, The John Waldron 
<a href="http://www.artlives.org/">Arts</a> Center, The 
<a href="http://www.buskirkchumley.org/">Buskirk-Chumley</a>(Buskirk) 
Theatre, <a href="http://www.festered.net/festers.htm">
Uncle Fester's</a>, and the <a href="http://www.yogis.com/cg/">City Grill</a>.  
The Waldron and the Buskirk 
are also good places to see plays, which you can also find at the Bloomington 
<a href="http://www.newplays.org/">Playwrites'</a> Project, 
on campus at I.U., and in 3rd Street Park in the summer.  Bear's Place, 
together with I.U., also hosts the <a href="http://www.theryder.com/">
Ryder</a> Film Series, which specializes in the coolest 
second-run/foreign/classic films out there. If you're looking to curl up
with a good book, Howard's Bookstore, on the South side of the square, has a 
good selection of books, as well as a cat or two wandering around; The Book 
Corner, at the corner of Kirkwood and Walnut, has some fine books; and 
<a href="http://www.boxcarbooks.org">Boxcar Books</a> has something for the 
more politically minded. Alternative videos and DVDs can be found at Plan 9, 
on 6th between Walnut and Washington, and a new video store, 
<a href="http://www.thecinemat.com">Cinemat</a> offers &quot;Fine Video &amp; DVD 
Rentals&quot; as well as movie screenings.

<a name="I.U." id="I.U."><h2>Indiana University</h2></a>

I don't want to discount the cultural offerings of 
<a href="http://www.iub.edu">I.U.</a>, though I think 
supporting local stuff to be important.  The 
<a href="http://www.music.indiana.edu/flash/virtualtour/noflash/mac/">
Musical Arts Center(MAC)</a> is the 
only place I know of to see a symphony or an opera in town.  They also bring 
Broadway plays and world-famous entertainers to the 
<a href="http://www.iuauditorium.com/0506/default.asp">I.U. Auditorium</a>	.  
Smaller up-and-coming bands are often booked to play in the 
<a href="http://www.imu.indiana.edu/index.html">I.U. Memorial 
Union</a>.  Art from throughout the world and history can be found in the 
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~iuam/iuam_intro.htm">I.U. 
Art Museum</a> and student work and travelling shows can be found in 
the 
<a href="http://www.fa.indiana.edu:16080/~sofa/main.html">School of Fine Arts(SOFA) 
Gallery</a>.  Student recitals can be heard on 
Sundays at 
<a href="http://www.music.indiana.edu/flash/virtualtour/noflash/simon/auer.shtml">
Auer Hall</a>.

<a name="radio" id="radio"><h2>Radio</h2></a>

I don't listen to the radio much, but I think it's really cool that we 
have a community radio station in Bloomington, 
<a href="http://home.bluemarble.net/~wfhb/">WFHB</a>, at 91.3 and 
98.1 FM. They play a lot of cool stuff that you don't hear on commercial 
radio.  Broadcasting from 
I.U., we have <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~wfiu/">WFIU</a> 
at 103.7 FM, offering NPR content and <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~wius/">
WIUS</a> at 1570 AM, offering Pure Student Radio.  
The commercial options are not bad either, with 
<a href="http://www.wttsfm.com/">WTTS</a> at 92.3 playing rock and 
<a href="http://www.wbwb.com">B97</a>(WBWB) at 96.7 FM playing 
dance and hits.
