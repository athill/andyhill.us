So I'm 31 years old and I'm still looking for some contentness in life.  I feel like I've
always tried to be a good person and to do my best, and i would recommend the same for 
others,even though it hasn't really worked out for me.
<br>
I grew up in Northeast suburban Indianapolis, with a brother and two parents who are 
actually still together.  I didn't do very well socially in high school and wasn't too 
concerned about doing well academically. I got B's to pacify my parents, but was primarily 
into musicand intoxication.
<br>
At 18, I graduated from (North Central) high school and went to Indiana University in 
Bloomington, IN. I was very into the Grateful Dead at this time. I studied Anthropology 
because it interested me at the time and when the Gulf War hit, I got increasingly into 
activism.I was quite popular at this time, sporting reddish-orange dred-locks and being 
the super-hippie-boy.  However, as life progressed, I became increasingly disillusioned 
with school,activism, and the hippie subculture.  My lack of a female companion, I 
believe, fed my frustrations in these other areas.<br>At 21, I dropped out of school to 
experience the "real world." At this point, I listened to Pantera, Metallica, Ministry, 
NWA, and Too $hort, the Misfits, the Dead Kennedys, among others.  Anger was the order 
of the day. I still wanted to make the world a better place, but I thought that those who 
lacked angerwere not serious.  I worked a string of food-service jobs, generally quitting 
after a shorttime because I thought they were trying to rip me off.  The dream of being 
a professionsal musician, which was supposed to be my ticket out of the work-a-day world, 
still seemed plausible at this point.<br>Needless to say, the girlfriend thing still 
wasn't happenning.  The basic pattern was/is Andy falls for girl, girl doesn't care, 
Andy considers life meaningless.  Did i mention Iended up in the Stress Center twice 
during this time?  That's on top of all the fun I had after receiving a DUI.
<br>
So by 2000, I was holding on to jobs, though they were still food service(in back). 
I decided to go back and get my degree. Starting in General Studies, I quickly moved 
to Computer Sciencein the hopes of making cash.  Obviously, any dreams of being a musician 
or any type ofcreative person had been dashed, as my muse had been suffocated by 
loneliness and deferment.
<br>
So now it's getting to the end of 2001 and I'm knee-deep in this computer science thing, 
which I feel pretty ambivelent about.  I guess it's cool that I might make money some 
day, I hope I can at least make enough to pay my debts fairly soon.  Especially as my 
apartment burned down this summer and the insurance company is holding me liable for 
$12,000. And I'm still alone and at this point I don't blame women for not wanting me.  
I mean, I'm broke and in debt and I'm basically a shadow of the optimistic boy I once 
was.  And my reward for all myhard work and kindness is to go about my endless toil and 
watch others enjoy the happiness that Doesn't seem to be headed into my life anytime soon.  
It pretty much sucks.
<br><br>
I wish you better luck than I've had.
