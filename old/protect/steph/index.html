<P>So this page is dedicated to Stephanie at the Uptown
	Cafe, who in addition to being 

the prettiest girl in the universe, is also
	all woman, a great waitress, an outstanding 

actress, has the most
	beautiful voice, great taste, charm, wit, and , I don't know? 

Integrity? I could go on forever, or until I ran out of compliments. She's got the
 

greatest sense of humor. I just laugh and smile all the time when she's
	around and miss 

her when she's gone. And if I can't be her husband or
	boyfriend, I want to be her 

father/brother/friend/fan because she blows me
	away every time and I love it and want 

more of it and dedicate all my
	struggles to her cause, because she is the bomb, the 

inspiration, and a
 good excuse to endure this wretched world(i guess it's not that bad
	

really.)
